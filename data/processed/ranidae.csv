The frog lives in Japan, Korea, China (Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Juangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces, as well as Ningxia-Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions) and the former Soviet Union. In the latter area, the range is subdivided into two main parts: the Far East and Turkmenia. In the Far East, the frog is distributed in the valleys of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers and their tributaries. The westernmost Far Eastern known locality is Khinganskii Nature Reserve in the Amur Province (49º05'N,130º36'E). Tadpoles of the Dark-Spotted Frog were introduced in 1959 - 1961 with herbivorous fish fry from China (Hubei Province) into ponds of the Karamet-Niyaz Settlement, Kerki District, Turkmenia. Since the introduction, the species has successfully populated this locality. However, this population does not disperse along the Kara-Kum Channel over long distances. 
The Dark-Spotted Frog lives in meadows, different types of forests, bushlands and in desert (Turkmenia). Within these landscape types, it inhabits different types of water bodies, including river pools, channels, lakes, ponds, swamps, ditches and rice fields. In Turkmenia, the frog is strictly associated with riparian, overgrown parts of ponds, channels and irrigation ditches, whereas in the Far East it regularly occurs 2-15 m from water. In general, however, this frog displays a high site-fidelity. As a rule, it uses stagnant waters, rarely occurring in the shallows of rivers, covered with dense vegetation. It should be noted that in Turkmenia this species lives mainly separately from its relative, the autochthonous Marsh Frog (Rana ridibunda). Only in few ponds do these two species co-occur. 
 
 
 
 

","
Over a large part of the range, the Dark-Spotted frog is a common species, but the distribution in many areas is patchy, i.e. the frogs occur in dense groups. Hibernation occurs from late September - November to February - May in water, generally in large stagnant ponds and lakes, but sometimes in streams. Reproduction occurs soon after hibernation. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary). The clutch contains 600-5000 eggs. Metamorphosis occurs from May to August, depending on latitude and altitude. Sexual maturity is probably attained at an age of 2 years; maximum longevity is estimated to be 13 years.  
Tadpoles consume primarily plants (algae etc.). Adults primarily eat spiders, terrestrial insects and other invertebrates. Vertebrates (fish fry, amphibians etc.) are rarely eaten. Feeding does not cease during the breeding season. 
 
 
 
 

","

","

","
The species often occurs in anthropogenic landscapes, including towns and cities. There is a tendency towards dispersal of the species in the Far East.

Rana plancyi is a large sized frog (85 mm SVL for females and 50 mm SVL for males). It has a pointed snout in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct.  Paired dorsolateral glandular folds are wide and distinct (Lue 1990).
The dorsum and sides are grassy green with thick golden brown stripes on the dorsum running from snout to vent. Ventrally, Rana plancyi is white (Lue 1990).

","
This species is present in Taiwan (primarily the mid-northern regions) and the eastern provinces of China, including Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and possibly Jiangxi. It is uncertain whether this species is present in Korea (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008).  Rana plancyi is more commonly found in plains and hills at lower elevation, closer to sea level (Lue 1990), but does occur up to 1,200 m asl (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008). It is found in ponds (particularly lotus ponds), paddy fields, and ditches (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008). 
","
R. plancyi can be easily observed both at night and during the day. It leaps into the water when approached by potential predators (Lue 1990). Breeding is in still water (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008).
When viewed dorsally, Rana plancyi generally assumes a triangular position with its legs as the base (Lue 1990).

","

","
Although this species is common, it is declining. Water pollution and urbanization, along with consumption and trade in China are thought to be causing the decline. It does occur within a number of protected areas (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008).
","
In 2007, a case study was reported where a 70 year old man was thought to have contracted eosinophilic meningitis from ingesting a raw Rana plancyi frog infected with rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). However, more research is needed to confirm that the parasite is actually contracted through ingestion and not just through direct contact (Lai et al. 2007).

The Moor Frog inhabits the zones of tundra, forest tundra, forest, forest steppe, and steppe. In Europe, the frog generally inhabits drier and more open sites than the Common Frog (Rana temporaria), including forest edges and glades, swamps, meadows, fields, bushlands gardens, etc. In Siberia, the species lives mainly in open swamps. The frog penetrates tundra and steppe in association with arboreal vegetation, primarily along intrazonal landscapes of river valleys. At the southern and northern limits of its range, in tundra, forest, and true steppes, the species lives near water bodies: rivers, lakes etc. There the populations of R. arvalis seem to be isolated. Spawning and early development occurs in stagnant waters, including lakes, ponds, swamps, puddles and ditches, which are from several meters to some hectares in area and from few centimeters to two meters in depth.





","
Rana arvalis is one of the most abundant amphibians in the Central and Eastern Europe, as well as West Siberia. There, its population density reaches several hundred individuals per hectare. Local density may be higher, such as in breeding ponds where 15-20 individuals per 1 m2 can be found. In the forests of the center of European Russia, it usually prefers more open habitats than the sympatric Common Frog, and is rarer than the latter in the north, whereas the proportion gradually changes to the south and southeast in favor of R. arvalis,> and at the south of the zone of sympatry it significantly outnumbers R. temporaria. The proportion of the two species varies also by year, and in some areas the dominance of one or another species alternates. Density-dependent regulation is important in overcrowded tadpole groups, where several hundred individuals per liter sometimes occur, as well as in the dense groups of recently metamorphosed froglets. However, habitat peculiarities and fluctuations in weather and climate appear to be more important in terms of the overall population dynamics.

The Moor Frog in the European region is probably a more thermophilous species than the sympatric Common Frog. It frequently occurs in warmer and drier microhabitats. Hibernation extends from September - November to February - June, in dependence on latitude. The earliest appearance (February) and latest disappearance (late November - December) takes place in the plain areas at the southwest of the species distribution, whereas the latest appearance (June) and earliest disappearance (September) is in the Polar Urals. Reproduction occurs from March - June, usually some days after the end of hibernation. Males form breeding choruses. Amplexus is pectoral (axial). The total duration of the breeding season within a pond is 3-28 days. Eggs are deposited in shallow, well-warmed sites, during both day and night. However, spawning by the Moor Frog peaks later than that of the Common Frog; it prefers more open and shallow wetlands for reproduction. The clutch contains 500-3000 eggs deposited usually in one, rarely in two clumps.

Metamorphosis occurs from the beginning of June to October in different regions. In general, the duration of development before metamorphosis shortens in the north and the south of the distribution. Formation of dense schools of tadpoles, where density-dependent regulation of development takes place, is typical. The density does not influence larval survival rate directly but influences the probability of successful metamorphosis because fast developing tadpoles often complete their transformation, while slowly developing individuals die in drying wetlands. ""Delayed"" larvae metamorphosed into froglets at significantly smaller body sizes and possessed less energy reserves. This may be evidence of lower viability. However, in good living conditions, their compensatory growth may enable them to reach the size of specimens from early clutches. However, this compensatory growth takes place relatively seldom, and more often the growth does not depend on individual size after metamorphosis. Sexual maturity is attained in the 2nd-5th year of life. On average, females mature later and have a longer life span than males. The maximum life span recorded for this species is 11 years old.

Moor Frog tadpoles eat Chlorophyta, Cladocera, and other algae, higher plants, detritus, as well as small amounts of invertebrates. Recently metamorphosed froglets forage on Acarina, Collembola and other microarthropods. Adults consume mainly terrestrial prey, aquatic invertebrates (slugs, diving beetles etc.) are consumed in smaller proportions and, as a rule, irregularly. Feeding ceases during the reproductive season.





","

","
The species is generally neither declining, nor threatened. However, isolated peripheral populations may be vulnerable from human influences and deserve special attention or protection. Only in some areas highly transformed by people (destruction of breeding ponds and adjacent terrestrial habitats, especially during urbanization, recreation and the overpasturage of cattle) have the populations declined.





","
In addition to the above mentioned anthropogenic factors of the species local declines, industrial pollution also negatively affects populations, including those living in cities. It leads to an increase of frequency of morphological abnormalities and disturbances in embryonic and larval development. Nevertheless, R. arvalis is a species easily adaptable to life in anthropogenic conditions. Some urban populations of this species are fairly large and safe, if suitable habitats are available. Some forms of human activity lead to an increase in the frog's number and their dispersal. For example, the construction of forest rides with numerous artificial holes filled with water.

Adult R. aurora range from 4.4 to 8.4 cm in length, with females significantly larger than males (Stebbins 1985; Hayes and Miyamoto 1984).  

The abdomen and underside of hind legs is characterized by a red or pinkish color, often set on a yellowish ground color (Stebbins 1985). Back is a brown, gray, olive, or reddish color, often with may small black flecks and irregular dark splotches, in some individuals forming a network of black lines (Stebbins 1985). 

  Dorsolateral folds are prominent.  

Tadpoles range in length from 14 to 80 mm, and are a dark brown or olive, marked with darker spots (Storer 1925). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
R. aurora ranges from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, south along the Pacific coast, west of the Cascade Ranges to Northern California. R. aurora  live in areas subject to temporal and spatial changes, and therefore make use of a variety of habits, consisting of both aquatic, upland and riparian (Draft Recovery Plan).  Adults breed in ponds or deep pools in slow-moving creeks.   Where ponds are seasonal in nature, thickets and logjams along riparian corridors provide important non-breeding habitat.  Populations are most likely to persist in areas with multiple breeding sites surrounded by suitable non-breeding habitat (N. Scott and G. Rathbun in litt. 1998). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
R. aurora  breed during a 1-2 week period between January and March, depending on locality (Stebbins 1985; Nussbaum et al. 1983).   Nelson et al. (2017), using passive acoustic monitoring devices, have shed light on this cryptically breeding ranid dispelling previous notions of their natural history. They found that red-legged frogs actually breed over the course of at least 32 days instead of a brief two week window as previously thought. Most interestingly, they report that underwater chorus length lasted nearly 8 hours on average, with a maximum chorus length of 14 hours over the course of a single day! Their acoustic analyses also showed calling effort was affected by temperature specifically reduced by cold snaps. 

Egg masses consist of between 300 and 5,000 eggs (Recovery Plan for the California Red-legged Frog 2002; Storer 1925; Fellers unpubl.).  Egg masses are nearly always attached to emergent vegetation, submerged beneath the surface in the deepest water available (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984; Licht 1969; Storm 1960).  Eggs hatch after 6 to 14 days depending on water temperature ( Jennings 1988). 

Larvae typically metamorphose in 3.5 to 7 months ( Storer 1925; Wright and Wright 1949), 
 but some overwinter and transform after more than 12 months in the larval stage (Fellers et al. in press).  Males may attain sexual maturity at 2 years, females at 3 (Jennings and Hayes 1985), 
 and adult frogs may live 8 to 10 years.  (Jennings et al in lit 1992). 
 
Larvae are thought to be algal grazers ( Jennings et al in lit 1992), and the adult diet consists mostly of invertebrates.  Pacific Tree Fogs (Hyla regilla) and California mice (Peromyscus californicus are occasionally consumed by adult frogs ( Hayes and Tennant 1985). 
  
Juvenile frogs may be active both nocturnally and diurnally, whereas adult frogs are primarily active nocturnally ( Hayes and Tennant 1985). 

The primary predators on R. aurora include garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and great blue herons (Ardea herodias).  Less frequently, red-legged frogs are eaten by American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus), black-crowned night herons(Nycticorax nycticorax), and rarely by red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus)(Jennings and Hayes 1990; Rathbun and Murphy 1996).  Other introduced species such as the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and non-native fish also prey on the frog. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
Many factors are contributing to the decline of R. aurora  populations, the main being habitat destruction and degradation.  Introduced predators and perhaps disease have also contributed to the decline of this species (Fellers et al in press) 

Rana aurora is of particular conservation concern in the Pacific Northwest, where their population has decreased in abundance and in site occupancy in recent years. Nelson et al. (2017), used passive acoustic monitoring devices to show that the species breeds longer than previously thought (see Life History) and demonstrated the importance of continued acoustic monitoring for this sensitive species,  especially because conservation strategies often rely on occupancy and detection surveys. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
The primary impact from humans has been from direct habitat loss, especially the construction of houses, shopping centers, and roads.  Much of the range of R. aurora  has been historically grazed, both by dairy and by beef cattle.  Cattle grazing in riparian zones causes serious damage to the vegetation, stream channel, and water quality. R. aurora  may have benefited from beef cattle grazing due to the increased number of stock ponds that are maintained for the cattle.  
R. aurora  are also threatened by a number of introduced (non-native) species, some of which are regularly introduced by humans.  These include sunfish, bass, trout, mosquitofish, and bullfrogs (Fellers et al in press). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
R. aurora  differs from its close relative, the California red legged frog, R. draytonii  in several ways.  Adult R. draytonii  are 35 to 40 millimeters longer than adult R. aurora  (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984). 
 The dorsal spots of R. draytonii  are more numerous, and usually have light centers (Stebbins 1985). 
 R. draytonii  also has rougher skin, shorter limbs and smaller eyes than R. aurora  (Stebbins 1985). 
 R. draytonii  has paired vocal sacs and typically calls from the air , while R. aurora  lacks vocal sacks ( Hayes and Krempels 1986; Licht 1969). 
  Egg masses in R. draytonii  are deposited such that the mass floats at the surface (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984), 
 whereas  R. aurora  submerge the mass in deeper water (Licht 1969; Storm 1960). 
  R. draytonii  breed from November to April (Storer 1925), 
 while R. aurora  breeds from January to March (Nussbaum et al 1983).

This frog lives in forests of different types, bushlands, swamps and marshes, near mountain and plain streams and brooks etc. In China it seems to be more of a mountain than plain dweller. 

","
The frog is not rare in many places (the abundance may exceed a hundred individuals per hectare), but peripheral populations seem to be small and isolated. The appearance after hibernation and the reproduction takes place from February to June, depending on latitude and altitude. Males form breeding choruses. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary). The clutch contains 800-1500 eggs. Metamorphosis takes place in summer. 
Tadpoles feed mainly upon algae, detritus and higher plants, adults upon invertebrates, mainly arthropods. In dry, steppe regions this frog spends a considerable part of time near water bodies, and aquatic organisms (e.g., Gammaridae) comprise a considerable part of its diet. 

","

","

","
Rana chensinensis does not avoid human inhabited areas and often occurs in anthropogenic landscapes, where it is subject to the same threats as majority of other anurans. In addition, this frog is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Special farms are used for breeding of this frog in China. 

","
Rana chensinensis belongs to the 'brown frog' species group. In the past (and sometimes at present), these frogs have been considered as the species R. temporaria Linne, 1758. Later studies revealed R. chensinensis to be a species complex, studies of which are in progress. These studies have revealed significant genetic and morphological distinctions between populations from the type territory of Rana chensinensis David, 1875 sensu stricto (Shaanxi Province of China) and the populations of the Rana chensinensis complex from other areas, including those in China (e.g., Beijing area). Consideration of some of these populations as separate species now is more or less commonly accepted (R. ornativentris, R. dybowskii, R. pirica); status of others is the subject of discussion. Here I conventionally use the species name R. chensinensis for those populations of the R. chensinensis complex whose taxonomic status remains unrevised.

The Agile Frog is widespread in Europe, from Southern Sweden (Oland Island) through Denmark, Northern France, Northeastern and Central Germany, parts of Austria, Hungary and the south of Ukrainian Carpathians. The species inhabits the Balkan Mountains southwards to the north of Asia Minor. The species is distributed very unevenly, being absent from a large areas within the range.
As a rule, the species inhabits leafed forests, consisting largely of oak and/or beech, hornbeam, ash etc. These forests often contain a thick layer of leaf litter. Reproduction occurs in well-illuminated and warm swamps in the forest or on forest edges. Such habitats are usually covered with dense herbaceous vegetation. In the south of its range, the species reproduces not only in stagnant but also in slowly running waters.






","
Rana dalmatina is active during the first half of the day and at twilight. During the reproductive period, it is active throughout the day and night. If the frog perceives danger, it escapes by very long, 1-2 m, and high, to 1 m, leaps. Hibernation starts at the end of September - end of October and lasts until late January - March. Reproduction usually occurs in March (sometimes February) to April. Breeding choruses are not formed. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary). The clutch contains 450-1800 eggs. Eggs are deposited at night on underwater vegetation in the most open parts of the pool. Metamorphosis occurs from late June to the beginning of August (and sometimes to October). Some tadpoles overwinter. Sexual maturity is probably attained in the third year of life; the maximum known age is 7 years. Adult R. dalmatina primarily consume terrestrial insects, whereas earthworms, spiders, myriapods etc. are rarely eaten.






","

","
In many sites the species has declined and some populations were extinct during the last decades. Habitat alteration seems to be the main threat for this species.
In the British Isles, R. dalmatina is restricted to Jersey. The species in this region had undergone such great decline that at one time it only bred in a single pond on the island. Efforts by Jersey environmental and conservation groups have successfully reintroduced breeding populations to several locations, including newly created and formerly occupied ponds (John W. Wilkinson & John Buckley, FrogLog 2012).





","
Although the frog lives in many anthropogenically changed landscapes, it seems to possess lower potential for synanthropization than many other brown frogs of the Palearctic.

Rana japonica has a slender body with a long narrow head.  The average snout-vent length is 48 mm for males and 54 mm for females.  Females are usually much larger than males.  The body color is usually reddish brown with sparse black bands on the limbs and lateral side of body.  Distinct black bands are seen along the canthus and behind the eyes, surrounding the tympanum.  Circular tympanum is about 4/5 of the eye diameter.  The skin of the back is nearly smooth with a few dermal ridges on the side.  Dorsalateral folds are clearly visible.  Webs are moderately developed.  Males develop yellowish brown nupital pads during the breeding season. Neither males nor females have vocal sac or vocal opening.  Mating call is clear and consists of ten to twenty notes.  A single note lasts as long as 2 seconds.               
","
Rana Japonica occurs in Honsyu, Shikoku, and Kyusyu in Japan and southern region of China.  Within Japan, Rana Japonica inhabits mostly in hillsides and plains, and is rarely seen in mountain ranges.  
","
The breeding season is January to March, the earliest of all frog species in mainland Japan.  Rana Japonica migrates from hillside to the breeding sites.  Spawning usually occurs in shallow still water of rice paddies or marshes.  The water temperature in the breeding season is around five to ten degrees.   
 
Occasionally, the breeding season of Rana Japonica overlaps with that of Rana ornativentris.  However, interbreeding rarely occurs because of the distinctively different mating calls.  Interbreeding does not result in hybrids, but is experimentally shown to cause male infertility.   
 
The egg mass is shaped like a smashed ball, about 10 cm in diameter, and contains 500-3,000 eggs.  The egg mass is deposited directly to the bottom of the spawning site.  In some years, the water temperature drops rapidly and freezing kills developing embryos.  Metamorphosis takes place between May and June.  Half of the froglets becomes sexually mature by late October of the same year.  The rest of the froglets mature in the following year.   
 
After completion of egg-laying, mature R.japonica become dormant underneath the mud of the rice-paddies or streams.  In May, they become active again and migrate back to the hillside or plains.  It is not clear whether or not R.japonica hibernate during the winter months.          
 
R.japonica prefer to feed on small animals, such as spiders, Diptera, Coleoptera and insect larvae.

The Columbia Spotted Frog is a large frog, and range in colors from brown, tan, or gray with irregular-shaped black spots with light-centers. The undersides are cream colored with an orange or salmon-colored pigment usually present on the hind legs and lower abdomen. In some Nevada populations the hind legs and abdomen of frogs are yellow. The hind legs are relatively short relative to body length and there is extensive webbing between the toes on the hind feet. The eyes are upturned. Females may grow to approximately 100 mm (4 inches) snout-to-vent length, while males may reach approximately 75 mm (3 inches) snout-vent length (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Stebbins 1985; Leonard et al. 1993).

Canada and the United States. Ranges from southeastern Alaska down into Canada (southwestern Yukon, northern British Columbia, western Alberta and east to Saskatchewan) and into the United States (Washington, east of the Cascade Mountains, eastern Oregon, western Montana, southwestern Idaho, central Nevada, western and north-central Wyoming, and north-central Utah (Wright and Wright 1949; Stebbins 1985; Green et al. 1997). In Washington, the species is known to occur at elevations ranging between 520 m (1720 feet; near Rock Lake, Whitman County) to 950 meters (6400 feet; at Hart’s Pass, Whatcom County) (Leonard et al. 1993). 

The Columbia Spotted Frog is a highly aquatic species and nearly always is found in close proximity to water. Breeding habitats include a variety of relatively exposed, shallow-water ((Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.). After breeding is completed, adults often disperse into adjacent wetland, riverine and lacustrine habitats. 


","
The timing of breeding varies widely across the species' range owing to differences in weather and climate, but the first visible activity begins in late winter or spring shortly after areas of ice-free water appear at breeding sites (Licht 1975; Turner 1958; Leonard et al. 1996). In Washington's Columbia Basin breeding typically occurs in late March or April, but at high-elevation montane sites breeding does not occur until late May or early June. 

Adults exhibit a strong fidelity to breeding sites, with oviposition typically occurring in the same areas in successive years. Males arrive first, congregating around breeding sites, periodically vocalizing ""advertisement calls"" in a rapid series of 3 to 12 ""tapping"" notes that have little carrying power (Davidson 1995; Leonard et al. 1996). It is unknown to what extent the weak calls serve to attract females, but they may serve to distribute males at the breeding sites thus minimizing male–male encounters. As a female enters the breeding area, she is approached by and subsequently pairs with a male in a nuptial embrace referred to as amplexus. From several hours to possibly days later, the female releases her complement of eggs into the water while the male, still clinging to the female, releases sperm upon the ova. 

Columbia Spotted Frogs have a strong tendency to lay their eggs communally and it is not uncommon to find 25 or more egg masses piled atop one another in the shallows. The egg masses are deposited in still, shallow water, either atop matted grasses or freely floating among clumps of herbaceous wetland plants. The water levels at breeding sites is usually so shallow that the upper portions of the egg masses protrude above the water surface. This habit often results in severe egg mortality from freeze-thaw damage or desiccation if temperatures fall below freezing or if rain ceases for a prolonged period during the embryonic period. 

After a few weeks, thousands of small tadpoles emerge and cling to the remains of the gelatinous egg masses. After several days the small hatchling tadpoles begin swimming and feeding upon algae, detritus, and in some cases, bacteria, using their minute brush-like mouthparts. In the Columbia Basin tadpoles may grow to 100 mm (4 inches) total length prior to metamorphosing into froglets in their first summer or fall. At high-elevation montane sites, however, tadpoles barely reach 45 mm in total length prior to the onset of metamorphosis in late fall.  

Mortality of eggs, tadpoles, and newly metamorphosed frogs is high, with approximately 5% surviving the first winter (David Pilliod, personal communication). At low-elevation sites sexual maturity is probably attained in two to three years, while three or four years may be required at high-elevation sites (Turner 1960; Licht 1975).

Food includes arthropods (e.g., spiders, insects), earthworms and other invertebrate prey (Whitaker et al. 1982). In turn, Columbia Spotted Frogs may be preyed upon by mink, river otter, raccoon, herons, bitterns, corvids, and garter snakes, while larvae may be consumed by larvae of dragonflies, predaceous diving beetles, fish, garter snakes, and wading birds. 


","

","
Its range overlaps with a number of protected areas.  Northern populations seem to be stable but other populations are declining, especially in some areas of Utah and Wyoming and possibly Idaho.  Threats include habitat degradation from cattle grazing,  agriculture, and logging as well as oil and gas exploration, and depletion of water tables and spring habitat from water development and diversion for irrigation.  Pollution from mosquito control agents might be a threat (Hammerson 2004).  

In a novel approach to understanding gene flow between populations of R. luteiventris in the Bighorn Crags, Salmon River Mountains, Idaho, Murphy et al. (2010) have used gravity modelling (previously used only in economic geography and transportation analyses).  Functional connectivity between R. luteiventris-occupied sites was found to be positively correlated with site productivity (measured by heat load index) and frost-free period between sites.  Functional connectivity was negatively correlated with local presence of predatory trout, between-site distance, and between-site topographic complexity.  The authors concluded that Bighorn Crags populations were already inhabiting very marginal habitat, due to climatic, thermal, and topographic factors, and that infrequent bursts of successful reproduction were sustaining these populations. Thus stresses that may push them over the edge (metaphorically) include the presence of introduced predatory trout and climate change, if pond permanence and moisture availability in dispersal habitat are reduced.

Since nearly the time of its original description in 1853, the systematics of the ""Western Spotted Frog"" group has been a source of some confusion and debate. In 1996, however, a team led by David M. Green published the results of a study on the genetics of Spotted Frogs and concluded that the group actually contained two ""sibling"" species—the Oregon Spotted Frog and the Columbia Spotted Frog  (Green et al. 1996, 1997). The decision to ""split"" the species was based upon the results of laboratory studies that indicated significant genetic differences, despite a lack of reliable morphological differences. Because the two species have allopatric ranges, they may be reliably identified based upon the location where a frog is encountered.

How will increasing temperatures from the climate crisis impact amphibian aging and mortality? Despite its relevance to conservation, little data exists on the relationship between temperature and senescence in free-living animals. Cayuela et al. (2021) studied pairs of frogs from two families divided by 100 million years of evolutionary history to answer this: Rana luteiventris and R. temporaria  (Ranidae) and Anaxyrus boreas and Bufo bufo (Bufonidae). The North American toads (Bufonidae) represented sampling along a climatic gradient, whereas the ranid frogs represented sampling from climatically contrasted sites. They found that actuarial senescence rates— i.e., the rate at which mortality increases with age— increased with the mean annual temperature experienced in all species. In all species but Anaxyrus boreas, increasing temperatures corresponded to decreasing lifespans. These relationships are presumably attributed to amphibians' increasing pace of life with increasing temperatures; they are active for longer periods, have a higher metabolism, lower mitochondrial efficiency, and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly. The impacts of increasing temperature on these frogs might be exacerbated by increasing evaporative water loss and influenced by genes involved in adapting amphibians to warmer conditions. In the ranids studied, the authors found increasing temperatures flipped sex differences in senescence rate in R. luteiventris but not R. temporaria. These results paint a grim picture for amphibians as global temperatures increase. Amphibian aging is expected to accelerate, with potential skewing sex ratios in some species.

Amphibians may be affected by climate change more than other terrestrial vertebrates, and they have the higher rates of decline in recent years. The Columbia Spotted Frog (Rana luteiventris) is a widespread North American frog that occurs across a variety of climate gradients, from subalpine forests to semi-arid deserts.  Pilliod and colleagues (2022) marked 15,885 adult Columbia Spotted frogs with subdermal transponders, with 33% recaptured at least once during their long term study (11-16 years depending on site). Within each population, adult survival and recruitment rates respond uniquely to seasonal temperature and precipitation variables, especially in winter and spring. Seasonal rain is a weak predictor of adult survival but was a useful predictor of juvenile recruitment, especially in three of the populations. Recruitment rates for each population peaked with different environmental gradients, depending on the amount of winter snowfall, and fall temperature and moisture levels. Thus recruitment may be responding to local conditions independently within each population. Their work emphasizes that local conditions and climate gradients need to be accounted for when managing climate effects on populations of amphibian species with broad geographic ranges.

This robust frog may be brown, reddish-brown or red above with a variable number of large, black spots and blotches on the back, sides, and legs. The spots are usually irregular-shaped, with indistinct edges and light  
centers. The skin on back and sides is often covered with small bumps and tubercles. The eyes are upturned. The lower abdomen and the undersides of the hind legs are usually colored by a reddish-orange or salmon-colored pigment that appears as though it has been painted on (Leonard et al. 1993; Nussbaum 1984; Stebbins 1985). Oregon spotted frogs have relatively short hind legs and extensive webbing between the toes of the hind feet. Sexually mature females range between 60 and 100 mm snout-vent  
length and males range between 45 and 75 mm (Licht 1975).

The Oregon spotted frog once occurred from southwest British Columbia through western Washington and Oregon into northeastern California. Today the species is known from three localities in British Columbia, four localities in Washington and approximately twenty-four localities in Oregon (Marc Hayes pers. comm.) (McAllister and Leonard 1997; Green et al. 1997).  
In Washington, it occurs at elevations ranging from 40 to 620 meters (McAllister and Leonard 1997) .  
 
Oregon spotted frog populations occur in association with relatively large wetland complexes. Breeding occurs in shallow, relatively unshaded emergent wetlands. The breeding ponds, which are typically dry by mid- to late summer, range in depth from 2 to 14 inches during the breeding season, and are vegetated by low-growing emergent species such as grasses, sedges (Carex spp.), and rushes (Juncus spp.). After breeding adults disperse into adjacent wetland and riparian habitats. Adults remain active year-around  
near sea-level, but freezing temperatures apparently cause adults and juveniles to hibernate in streams, oxbows and springs at higher elevations.  
 
 
 
 

","
Breeding occurs sometime in February or March at lower elevations, but does not occur until March or April at the two Washington sites in the Cascade Range (McAllister and Leonard 1997). The Oregon Spotted Frog exhibits strong fidelity to breeding sites and eggs are often deposited the same locations in successive years. 
 
Males arrive first, gathering in ""lek-like"" groups  and float in the shallows, calling while awaiting the arrival of a female. Male advertisement calls, consisting of a rapid series of 5 to 50 faint ""tapping"" notes notes, are given  
throughout the breeding season (particularly on sunny days) and again in fall (Davidson 1995; Leonard et al. 1997). Most breeding takes place within a two-to-three-week ""window"" when most of eggs are deposited. However, breeding may be interrupted for up to several weeks by the onset of cold weather; in such cases a second bout of breeding may occur. Upon release, the ova are tightly packed in a mass roughly the size of a ping-pong ball, but within a few hours the mass swells to the size of an average-size human fist. Females usually lay their eggs atop or adjacent to other egg masses (some of the larger aggregations may contain more than 100 individual egg masses). The egg masses are not attached to vegetation, but are deposited in still, shallow waters atop submergent herbaceous vegetation or freely floating amongst clumps of emergent wetland plants such as sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp). Often-times, the the upper portions of the egg masses protrude above the water surface resulting in severe egg mortality from freeze-thaw damage or desiccation.  
 
After a few weeks of embryonic development, thousands of small tadpoles emerge and cling to the remnants of the gelatinous egg masses, their densely packed, dark bodies acting as solar collectors and warming the water adjacent to the mass. After several days, the hatchlings become free-swimming tadpoles, using their minute brush-like mouthparts to feed upon algae, detritus, and, in some cases, bacteria (but see McDiarmid and Altig 1999).  
Tadpoles may grow to 90 mm total length before metamorphosing in their first summer or fall (Licht 1975) .  
 
Mortality of eggs, tadpoles, and newly metamorphosed frogs is high, and it is likely that only about 1% of an annual cohort survive to the first winter (Licht 1974) . Near sea-level sexual maturity is attained at age two, while at higher elevations one or  
two additional years is required (Licht 1975).  
 
Adults feed upon arthropods (e.g., spiders, insects), earthworms and other invertebrate prey. In turn, Oregon Spotted Frogs may be preyed upon by mink, river otter, raccoon, herons, bitterns, corvids and garter snakes (Licht 1974) , while larvae may be consumed by larvae of dragonflies, predacious diving beetles, fish, garter snakes and wading birds.  
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
This species is rare and has undergone significant declines in range over the past half century. It is now presumed to be extirpated in California and is in serious jeopardy in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. The most probable cause for this frog's precipitous decline is the hydrological modification and destruction (draining, flooding, and filling) of specialized shallow-water, emergent wetlands used for breeding. However, introduced predators including bullfrogs and sport fishes pose serious threats from predation and from competition for critical habitats.

The Commom frog inhabits Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals and West Siberia. The species inhabits almost all of western Europe except for Portugal, Central and Southern Spain and Italy, Greece (except for the most northeastern part), Southern Ukraine, and Southern European Russia. Southern margin of the range runs eastwards from Central Moldavia to the south of Ukraine (eastwards approximately along the line Odessa Province - Nikolaev Province - Kirovograd Province - Zaporozhie Province), then northeastwards approximately along the line: center of Dnepropetrovsk Province - Kharkov Province (Kharkov City, 50º00'N, 36º15'E), then in Russia: Byelgorod Province - south of Kursk Province. Then the margin runs eastwards to Voronezh Province, then northeastwards through Tambov Province to Penza and Ulyanovsk provinces, then southeastwards in Samara Province (Samara City: 53º12'N, 50º10'E) and Orenburg Province in the Southern Urals. From there, the frog penetrates Northwestern Kazakhstan (Uralsk Province, Dariinsk Settlement in the middle stretch of the Ural River: ca. 51º10'N, 51º40'E). From Orenburg Province of Russia, the margin rounds the Ural Mountains from the south and runs eastwards to northern Kazakhstan (Kustanai and Kokchetav provinces). At the southern limit of its range, the Common Frog is distributed unevenly and there is a tendency towards decline and extinction of some geographical populations and isolation of others.
The northern range limit extends from the southern shore of the Barents Sea and the northern shore of the White Sea. In the Kola Peninsula, the margin corresponds to the Barents Sea coast from the Norwegian border to the area between Kharlovka and Voyatka rivers, then southwards to the northern coast of Kandalaksha Bay. Southeastwards, in Arkhangelsk Province, the margin corresponds to the coast of the White Sea, including the Kanin Peninsula. From the latter, it runs southeastwards and eastwards through Komi Republic in Russia, approximately along the line: lower Shapkina River in Ust-Tsilma District (ca. 67ºN, 53ºE) - Vorkuta City (67º29'N, 64º00'E), then to the Polar Urals, then southwards along the Ob River and the lower Irtysh River, then to Kurgan Province and Northern Kazakhstan (North-Kazakhstan Province, surroundings of Petropavlovsk City: 54º52'N, 69º09'E). It should be noted that the known localities of the Common Frog in West Siberia (east of Sverdlovsk and south of Tyumen provinces) are distributed quite sporadically, so the range margin is poorly known. At least some areas in the southeast of Sverdlovsk Province (adjacent to Tyumen Province) are inhabited by only one brown frog, the Moor Frog (Rana arvalis), and another brown frog, the Siberian Frog (Rana amurensis), is known eastwards. The eastern margin of the distribution of R. temporaria needs elucidation.
Rana temporaria inhabits lowland and mountain deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, through which it penetrates tundra and the forest steppes. In the forest zone, it lives in quite diverse habitats: under forest cover, in glades, bushlands, dry and swampy meadows, swamps and different kinds of anthropogenic landscape (fields, gardens, parks, settlements, cities etc.). In general, in the forest zone, it inhabits quite different landscapes from dry and open areas to overmoistened, dense fir forests. In the northern and southern parts of its range, the frog tends to occur near ponds, lakes and rivers, spending more time in water, a habit typical for this species also in the forest zone in periods of droughts. At the northern limit of its distribution, R. temporaria lives in the forest and true tundras, usually on the shores of permanent lakes. At the southern limit of its range, the frog lives in insular forests in the forest and true steppes, riverside bushlands and plavni (dense riparian vegetation in southern arid regions). In these areas, the species lives only in very moist sites, particularly near the outcrops of ground waters, and behaves as a more hygrophilous species than sympatric R. arvalis. Reproduction and early development occur in the shallow (5-50 cm) waters of lakes, ponds, swamps, ditches, river- and stream pools and puddles with stagnant or semi-flowing water. Aquatic habitats are more diverse in the centre of the species range than on its periphery.

In the center of the forest zone, the Common Frog is usually the most abundant amphibian. For example, in mixed forests in the centre of European Russia, abundance varies depending on habitat and activity period approximately within the range of 1-250 specimens per 1000 m2. Rana temporaria is common also in agricultural areas and even settlements and cities. In the forests of the center of European Russia, it usually prefers denser parts of forest habitats than the sympatric Moor Frog, and is rarer than the latter in the south, whereas the proportion gradually changes to the north and northwest in favor of R. temporaria. The proportion of the two species varies also by years and in some areas the dominance of one or another species alternates. Density-dependent regulation is important in overcrowded tadpole groups, where several hundred individuals per liter sometimes occur, as well as in the dense groups of recently metamorphosed froglets. However, habitat peculiarities and fluctuations in weather and climate appear to be more important in terms of the overall population dynamics. The Common Frog in the European region is probably a less thermophilous species than the sympatric Moor Frog. It frequently occurs in cooler and wetter microhabitats.
The frog usually hibernates in water: rivers, channels, ditches, springs, streams and lakes, primarily with a current. In underwater hibernacula, the Common Frog occurs in groups of many, sometimes few thousand individuals. Hibernation occurs from August - November to February - early June, depending on latitude and altitude. Reproduction occurs from March - late June, but generally in April over the main part of its distribution. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary), and it sometimes occurs on land on the way to the breeding pond.
The spawn in deposited usually in a large clump containing 670-4500 eggs. Many, sometimes hundreds and more, clumps form large aggregations. The advantages of embryonic development in large aggregations is that it minimizes temperature fluctuations and that it decreases predation potential, especially with regards to small predators, for example, invertebrates and newts, which are less successful in penetrating large aggregations than single clutches. In such masses, the temperature is a little higher than in the surrounding water. These factors lead to an increase in embryonic survival and probably accelerate development. On the other hand, the rate of embryonic development is slower and mortality is higher in the lower parts of the aggregation than in the upper parts because of hypoxia. In this respect, group spawning in shallow sites will be more advantageous than in deep sites.
Metamorphosis is completed usually in June - August. Larvae tend to concentrate into large schools in shallow water where their density sometimes reaches 100 individuals per liter. These schools may cover several hundred square meters, and the temperature there may be a little different from that in surrounding water. Crowding effect is typical for such tadpole aggregations, and the sizes of metamorphosed juveniles are variable. Larger juveniles usually metamorphosed first. They have higher survival rates during their first overwintering, which emphasize an advantage of early metamorphosis. Sexual maturity is attained no later than the 3rd year of life; the life span reaches 6 - 8 years, in the Polar Urals even 17 years.
The tadpoles consume mainly detritus, algae and higher plants. Animal food is consumed in smaller amounts. Plant and animal food diversity increase during the ontogenesis. At metamorphosis, feeding ceases for a short time after the appearance of the tadpole's forelegs. Recently metamorphosed juveniles primarily eat microarthropods: Acarina, Collembola, small larvae of Diptera. The food spectrum increases in postmetamorphic development. Adults eat mostly terrestrial prey, including Lumbricidae, Gastropoda, Aranei, Insecta etc. Aquatic prey, mainly insects and molluscs, are eaten in the largest amounts in the northern parts of the frog's distribution.
From the other hand, R. temporaria, as the another brown frog, R. arvalis, compose an important food component of many vertebrate animals. It is supposed that the dynamics of some mustelids depend on the population number and dynamics of these brown frogs. The helminth composition in R. temporaria is quite similar to that of the related frog, R. arvalis.

The species is generally neither declining, nor threatened. However, isolated peripheral populations may be vulnerable from human influences and deserve special attention or protection. Only in some areas highly transformed by people (destruction of breeding ponds and adjacent terrestrial habitats, especially during urbanization, recreation and the overpasturage of cattle) the populations are declining. In southern regions, the species is rare, but at its northern distribution in Europe it is common. However, in some West European countries (Great Britain, parts of Germany, Switzerland, etc.), the frog declines drastically due to industrial destruction and pollution of habitats (especially ponds and swamps).

Phillimore et al. (2010) suggests that projected increases in temperature for Britain (by 2050-2070) may be more than the Rana temporaria can handle, due to local adaptation. Their models predict that first spawning date for populations in southeast Britain will need to advance by about 21-39 days, but genetically influenced plasticity in spawning date may only allow an advance of 5-9 days. Gene flow northward from more southern populations already adapted to higher temperatures could help, but is unlikely due to the barriers of the English Channel and high urbanization.

Although many kinds of anthropogenic influences (habitat destruction and pollution, recreation, etc.) negatively affect many populations of the Common Frog, it is a species well-adaptable to life in anthropogenic conditions. Some urban populations of this species are fairly large and safe, if suitable habitats are available. Even a high level of exploitation of the frog population for purposes of medicine and education in some sites does not destroy them. Some forms of human activity lead to an increase in the frog's number and their dispersal. For example, the construction of forest rides with numerous artificial holes filled with water. Many frogs are caught for the purposes of education, medicine and science. Along with the Marsh Frog (Rana ridibunda), the Common Frog is the main subject for such collecting. The amount of these two frog species caught in the 1970s - 1980s in the former USSR measured by several tons annually. However, no population declines resulted from this.

The pathogenic amphibian fungus known as Bsal (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) may be the most potent amphibian disease and poses extreme risk to natural populations, especially in salamanders. First detected in Fire Salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in extreme southeastern Netherlands and adjacent Belgium and reported in 2013, it has spread to western Germany (with new reports from Bavaria), where it is having devastating effects. An entire issue of the journal Salamandra (2020, vol 56, issue 3, open access and available as PDF) is devoted to Bsal research centered in Germany. Salamander populations have essentially disappeared from the northern Eiffel region and are threatened in the southern Eiffel and Ruhr regions. Bsal has been present in Germany for at least 16 years and has been found in laboratory populations of the Common Frog, Rana temporaria, and field populations of the Great Crested Newt, Triturus cristatus. It is known to infect salamandrid species from southeast Asia, which appear to have been the source of the European outbreaks via pet trade importation. The goal in highlighting this important set of papers as stated by the editors ""must go beyond documenting declines towards understanding spatio-temporal disease dynamics and the factors influencing the spread and impact of Bsal in different situations."" In light of the seriousness of the Bsal threat in Germany, the authors' common goal is a national Bsal Action Plan, which would be of great importance for the international community of amphibian biologists and for the public (Written by David B. Wake).

Amphibians of high elevation mountain lakes face many threats: climate change, novel pathogens, development, and overexploitation; however, the presence of non-native fish is the most significant. A study in the Pyrenees (Miró et al 2020) found rapid natural recovery of amphibian communities when non-native fish were removed from eight study lakes and compared them to 56 nearby control lakes with and without fish. The fish-removal lakes achieved natural richness levels one year after fish removal began, and typical species abundances after three years (with the only exception of Rana temporaria). Colonization of removal lakes occurred only from residual populations in the same valley. This study provides another example that montane amphibian communities can recover rapidly after eliminating or reducing non-native fish, and bolsters this technique to help other endangered amphibians in similar habitats (Written by Vance Vredenberg).

How will increasing temperatures from the climate crisis impact amphibian aging and mortality? Despite its relevance to conservation, little data exists on the relationship between temperature and senescence in free-living animals. Cayuela et al. (2021) studied pairs of frogs from two families divided by 100 million years of evolutionary history to answer this: Rana luteiventris and R. temporaria (Ranidae) and Anaxyrus boreas and Bufo bufo (Bufonidae). The North American toads (Bufonidae) represented sampling along a climatic gradient, whereas the ranid frogs represented sampling from climatically contrasted sites. They found that actuarial senescence rates— i.e., the rate at which mortality increases with age— increased with the mean annual temperature experienced in all species. In all species but Anaxyrus boreas, increasing temperatures corresponded to decreasing lifespans. These relationships are presumably attributed to amphibians' increasing pace of life with increasing temperatures; they are active for longer periods, have a higher metabolism, lower mitochondrial efficiency, and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly. The impacts of increasing temperature on these frogs might be exacerbated by increasing evaporative water loss and influenced by genes involved in adapting amphibians to warmer conditions. In the ranids studied, the authors found increasing temperatures flipped sex differences in senescence rate in R. luteiventris but not R. temporaria. These results paint a grim picture for amphibians as global temperatures increase. Amphibian aging is expected to accelerate, with potential skewing sex ratios in some species.

Habitat loss or modification is the biggest threat to amphibians, which includes the introduction of non-native plants. Eucalyptus globulus trees have been introduced globally from its native Australia, and its negative effects on native species, including adult amphibians, have been documented. What about other stages? Iglesias-Carrasco et al. (2022) investigated with experiments on the effects of eucalypt leachates on tadpole behavior, morphology, growth, and immune response. Rana temporaria, Alytes obstetricans, and Pelophylax perezi tadpoles were raised in mesocosms with either native oak or exotic eucalypt leachates then exposed to predator cues. The authors found that while anti-predator responses were not significantly affected, tadpoles raised in eucalypt leachates were smaller and had weaker immune responses. Furthermore, the morphology of P. perezi tadpoles in eucalypt treatments were similar to the stress morphology of other species, which may affect the tadpoles’ ability to escape predators and jump in later development. Although species varied in responses, these results indicate that the poor nutrient content and high toxicity of Eucalyptus have strong impacts at critical early stages of frog development. Further studies are needed to fully understand the long-term fitness consequences of Eucalyptus monocultures. (Written by Ann Chang)
