Dorsal skin is pustulate; males have a larger concentration on the top and sides of head (Hoogmoed 1969).  
Males also have more spotting on the throat.  Dorsum coloration varies from bronze, grayish-brown, gold, or yellowish-tan darker mottling and with golden-yellow dorsolateral stripes. Photographs can be found in Gaige (1926) and  
Bokermann (1958);  
cranial osteology and a detailed dorsal view of a specimen can be found in Lynch and Freeman (1966). 
 
 The holotype measured 31 mm (Gaige 1926),  
all specimens since have been smaller. In Lynch and Freeman (1966), the largest male measured 20.6 mm SVL and largest female measured 26.6 mm SVL. Duellman (1997)   
collected 17 specimens from Venezuela, and the largest female was 27 mm and largest male was 24.6 mm. Snout subacuminate when viewed dorsally; sloping posteroventrally when viewed laterally. Tympanum only visible in males. Webbing absent on hands, 2/3 webbed on hindfeet.  
 
Family-level morphological characters for Allophryne ruthveni follow those mentioned by Lynch and Freeman (1966):  
1. Presacral vertebrae procoelus, eight in number; 2. Parahyoid absent; 3. Free ribs lacking; 4. Bidder's organ absent; 5. Intercalary cartilages present; 6. Coccyx articulating with sacrum by two condyles; 7. Tarsal bones not fused; 8. Pectoral girdle arciferal; 9. Epicoracoidal horns present, free; 10. Terminal phalanges T-shaped; 11. Sacrum procoelus and diapophyses expanded; 12. Maxillae, premaxillae, and prevomers edentate; 13. Cranial roofing bones well ossified. Character ""9"" is shared with Centrolenidae, Bufonidae, Hylidae, and Leptodactylidae. Character ""6"" an important character state for placement in Centrolenidae and Hylidae, has been rejected by Ford and Cannatella (1993) as serial sections of toes did not show the presence of true intercalary cartilage. 
","
Distributional map (taken for this account) and a picture of a living specimen can be found in Caldwell and Hoogmoed (1998).

Duellman (1997)   
found males vocalizing early in the evening and at night following a storm. Calling takes place on vegetation in the forest 1-2 meters above water-filled depressions. A pair was spotted in axillary amplexus 1.5 meters above the ground; they produced approximately 300 pigmented eggs in a plastic bag following capture. Eggs were deposited in water; Duellman saw this life history trait as support for their placement within the Hylidae.  

Caldwell (1996)   
reported a congregation of several hundred individuals calling from 1-3 m above the ground at the edge of the rising waters of the Rio Xingu in Para, Brasil. Hoogmoed (1969)  
 collected all his specimens within 100 m of a creek or river in Surinam. Caldwell and Hoogmoed (1998)  
describe the vocalization as a low, raspy trill. Call rate is 18 notes per minute; mean call duration is 352.5 ms; dominant frequency is 4.71 kHz.

Currently within the family Allophrynidae, with its only congener A. resplendens.
 
Phylogenetic uncertainty has plagued this species since its discovery (Gaige 1926)   
despite morphological (Skin-Hoogmoed 1969 osteology- Lynch and Freeman 1966)  
and recent molecular (Austin et al. 2002)   
studies attempting to clarify its place within the anuran clade.  
Originally placed in the family Bufonidae by Gaige (1926)   
(leptodactylids at this time were considered to be bufonids (Ford and Cannatella 1993)) 
after referencing NobleÃ¯Â¿Â½s (1922) characters for the bufonids. It has since been placed in Leptodactylidae (Gallardo 1965), 
 Centrolenidae, Hylidae (Noble 1931; Lynch and Freeman 1966; Duellman 1970; Duellman 1975; Duellman 1977; Frost 1985; Duellman and Trueb 1986),  
and in its own family the Allophrynidae (Savage 1973; Savage 1986; reviewed in Caldwell and Hoogmoed 1998 and Austin et al. 2002)  
 
 Bokermann (1958) described a new species, Sphoenohyla seabrai, from Serra do Navio, AmapÃ¯Â¿Â½, Brasil that he later found to have been synonymous with Allophryne ruthveni (Bokermann 1966).  
 
Molecular work with 16s and 12s rRNA Ã¯Â¿Â½provisionally supports the notion that Allophryne ruthveni is sister [basally positioned] to the Centrolenidae, although some analysis (not shown) did place Allophryne ruthveni within the CentrolenidaeÃ¯Â¿Â½ (Austin et al. 2002). This relationship is weakly supported.

Castroviejo-Fisher et al (2012) described its only confamilial and congeneric species, A. resplendens, and proposes a combination of characters that may be diagnostic for the family. However a thorough phylogenetic analysis is hampered by a lack of robust samples for A. resplendens.

Small stocky frog with a short head. Males attain a snout-vent length of up to
 36 mm, whereas females grow up to 42 mm. The eyes are large and have a vertical
 slit-shaped pupil. Parotoid glands are small, and the tympanum is clearly 
visible. One or two rows of small, often reddish warts are present on the 
upper eyelids.  The skin is warty, and a row of large warts extends from the
 tympanum to the groin area. Other large gland complexes are present on the 
underarms and the ankles. There are two metacarpal tubercles. The limbs are
 shorter than in other species of Alytes. The coloration is usually 
brownish with more or less pronounced dark spots. Warts are mostly red in 
color. The eyes are often connected with a light colored band. The underside 
is an unspotted dirty white (Noellert and Noellert 1992).  
Males are smaller than females. Other features that distinguish males and females are: distance between nostrils, head width, lower jaw length, vertical diameter of tympanum and tibia-fibula length. These variables should be corrected for the size of the animal (Bosch and Marquez 1996).

Alytes cisternasii is endemic to the Iberian penninsula, inhabiting the south-western
  and central parts of this region. Presumably derived from an
 Alytes obstetricans-like ancestor, this species has adapted to lower and drier environments, having acquired a more markedly fossorial lifestyle than the two congeneric
 species, Alytes obstetricans and Alytes muletensis. 
In Portugal, it occupies the whole country south of the Lousa-Estrela mountain 
system, extending north through the oriental regions of the provinces of Beira Baixa, Beira Alta and TrÃ¡s-os-Montes. In Spain, to the north of the Central mountains, Alytes cisternasii is distributed over the provinces of Zamona, Salamanca, Avila, Valladolid, Segovia, and to the south of the Central mountain system, over the regions of Madrid, Guadalajara, Toledo, Caceres, Badajoz, Ciudad Real, Huelva, Sevilla, Cordoba and Jaen (limited in the south-east by the Quadalquivir river).
This amphibian is, generally, associated with xeric environments, with
 sclerophyte vegetation of the Mediterranean type - open forests of 
Quercus ilex, Q. rotundifolia, Q. suber, - and with brushwood  
of Q. coccifera, Cystus ladanifer and C. monspeliensis. 
It prefers soils that are not very consistent, usually sandy-granitic,
 wherein it buries itself. Especially in the south of its distribution
 range, it lives in the vicinity of streams of a temporary nature, which
 frequently regress in summer.   
In Portugal, the species is predominantly found between 100 and 600m,
 reaching its maximum altitude in the Serra de Monchique (Algarve), at
 750m. In Spain, although more frequent in low altitudes, it can be found
 above 1000m (1200m, Presa de Voltoya, Avila; 1110m, Villacastin, Segovia)
(Gasc 1997).

These frogs are well known for the parental care behavior of males. The females can 
produce up to four clutches per breeding season. Mating season is between 
September and March, with its peak in October/November. Males produce
 advertisement calls for several hours every night during the breeding season.
 The females reply by calling back with a lower intensity than the males.  
The following account of the mating behavior of A. cisternasii has been
 altered from Marquez and Verrell (1990). A more detailed account can be
 found there.
The female seeks out the male and presents herself to him. The male grabs the
 female in the lumbar region. The female responds by rocking her body 
side-to-side. The male pedals with his hind legs against the substratum, 
resulting in a vigorous forward-backward movement of the male's body. The
 male then rocks his body slightly backward and forward, in a much less 
intense way as the pedaling motion. After some time, the male suddenly
 constricts the female's flanks.  She extends her hind legs and adopts 
a posture much like the antipredator ""unkenkrampf"" (unken reflex) as seen in the genus
 Bombina, and ejects an egg mass into the trough between her thighs.
 The male then releases his lumbar grip, takes an axillar hold and inseminates
 the eggs with a quantity of liquid sperm mass. After 10-15 minutes, the
 male distends the egg mass with his hind legs, applies them alternatingly to 
his body and extends them again until the strings of eggs are wound around 
his ankles.  A male can copulate anew and carry up to four clutches around 
his legs with a total of 180 eggs or more (Noellert and Noellert 1992). 
 Eggs are 2.6-3.5mm in diameter directly after laying and grow to 4.3-4.4 mm (likely through uptake of water).
 Males keep the egg mass moist by microhabitat choice, or by taking short baths.
 The males seek out small water bodies to discard the egg strings with the 
hatching larvae. Upon hatching, the larvae are about 13 mm and metamorphose 
when they have reached a maximum length of 70 mm, after 110 to 140 days at a
 development temperature of 20ÂºC. Newly metamorphosed toadlets have a
 snout-vent length of 2 4mm. Sexual maturity is reached at an age of at 
least 2 years.












","

","
Honnegger (1981) reports that the populations of A. cisternasii
 are declining for unknown reasons.
Portuguese populations of A. cisternasii do not seem to be particularly
 endangered. In fact, this is one of the most common amphibian species south of 
the Tagus River. Similarly, Spanish populations are not, in general, threatened. 
However, in some areas, for example around Madrid, the species is a victim of 
the accelerated destruction of the Mediterranean forest (Gasc 1997).

Alytes obstetricans is a small, stocky frog with a relatively large and flat head. Adults have  a snout-vent length of about 39 - 55 mm. The eyes are large and have a vertical slit-shaped pupil. The skin has small warts. The parotid glands are small, and the tympanum is mostly visible. Other large gland complexes are present on the underarms and the ankles. The hands have three palmar tubercles, with long, slender digits, and the relative finger lengths of I < II = IV < III (Noellert and Noellert 1992; Salvador 1996).

Alytes dickhellini and A. muletensis do not have the orange and red dorsal dots or the marked dorsal warts that A. obstetricans possesses. Alytes cisternasii can be differentiated based on their only having two metacarpal tubercles, while other species in the genus, including A. obstetricans, have three. Other than these differences, the species in this genus tend to be quite similar, especially in the case of A. obstetricans and A. almogavarii (Arntzen and GarcÃ­a-ParÃ­s 1995).

In life, the dorsal coloration is grayish brown and has varying dots from small black or brown dots to olive or green spots. The underside is a dirty white, and the throat and the chest are often spotted with gray (Noellert and Noellert 1992, Salvador 1996). There are characteristic orange or red dorsal dots as well (Arntzen and GarcÃ­a-ParÃ­s 1995). The iris is a golden color (Salvador 1996).

The males are somewhat smaller than the females (Bosch and Marquez 1996). As of 2023, there are three recognized subspecies: A. o. obstetricans, A. o. pertinax, and A. o. boscai, and an additional unnamed subspecies (Ambu et al. 2023). The subspecies, A. o. pertinax, has a more elongated head and more uniform color patterns than A. o. boscai (GarcÃ­a-ParÃ­s and MartÃ­nez-Solano 2001).  
","
This species occurs in eight European countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, and Switzerland. Alytes o. obstetricans occurs north of the Pyrenees and A. o. boscai occurs south of the Ebro river. The species is present practically throughout France, with the exception of the higher part of the Alps. The northernmost population is found south of Hannover, in lower Saxony, and the easternmost population is found in Northern and Central Germany (hilly regions of ThÃ¼ringen and Harz). In Southern Germany the species only occurs in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in the region of the Black Forest. Alytes obstetricans prefers to live in mountainous and hilly regions (Gasc 1997). 

In the Iberian Peninsula, A. obstetricans occurs from the sea shore (e.g. in Asturias and Basque Country) up to 1960 m in Portugal, and 2400 m in the Pyrenees. In the Alps, populations can be found up to 1670 m in the Bernese Oberland. In Central Europe, most populations live at altitudes between 200 and 700 m, rarely below 200 m (Gasc 1997).
","
Mating season varies throughout the range. In Westfalen, Germany, one can find males carrying eggs between the end of March and the beginning of August. Around the city of La CoruÃ±a, Spain, males with clutches of eggs were observed from mid-February until August. In mountain populations, most males carry eggs well into August (Noellert and Noellert 1992).

Although males call mainly at night, they are known to call from their hiding places during the daytime. The call is high-pitched with about one call every 1 - 3 sec, usually higher and shorter than the genus Bombina. The female seeks out the male and presents herself to him, although the female has also been observed calling back in an alternating song in the mountainous regions of Germany (Noellert and Noellert 1992). The male grabs the female in the lumbar region and stimulates the femaleâ€™s cloacal region by scratching it with his toes. After about 35 minutes, the male suddenly constricts the female's flanks. She extends her hind legs and ejects an egg mass. The male then releases his lumbar grip, takes an axillary hold and inseminates the eggs with a quantity of liquid sperm mass (Schleich 1996). 

These frogs are well known for their male parental care behavior.  Approximately  10 - 15 minutes after fertilizing the eggs, the male distends the egg mass with his hind legs, piles them alternately to his body and extends them again until the strings of eggs are wound around his ankles. The males attach the egg masses to their body and carry them until the eggs hatch  (Schleich 1996). Males keep the egg mass moist by microhabitat choice, or by taking short baths. Larvae hatch after 3 to 6 weeks. The males seek out small water bodies to discard the egg strings with the hatching larvae (Engelmann et al 1985). 

The females can produce up to four clutches of eggs per breeding season. A male can copulate anew and carry up to three clutches around his legs with a total of 150 eggs or more (Schleich 1996).

Alytes obstetricans prefers permanent waters, because larvae often over winter in water. The land habitat is just as important as the breeding sites: slopes, walls, embankments with many small stones, stone slabs or sand, normally with sparse vegetation are preferred. Larger colonies are observed in gravel or clay pits. Often the exposition is south, southwest or southeast and well exposed to the sun. The microclimate in the hiding places must be warm and humid (Gasc 1997; Noellert and Noellert 1992).
","
Once hatched, the larvae are about 15 mm and metamorphose the next year, when they have reached a maximum length of 5 to 8 cm (Engelmann et al 1985). 

The A. o. pertinax larvae have a color pattern more similar to Alytes dickhilleni than to A. o. boscai (GarcÃ­a-ParÃ­s and MartÃ­nez-Solano 2001).
","
The main threat to this species is the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, otherwise known as Bd, which the species is susceptible to. Populations along the northern border, e.g., in Limburg, eastern Germany, in the Black Forest and western and central parts of the Swiss range, have disappeared for no obvious reason, but the disappearance is presumed to be disease-related. Additionally, in 1997, 1998, and 1999, mass die-offs of post-metamorphic A. obstetricans occurred in Spain, and dead frogs were found to have chytrid infections (Bosch et al. 2001). As a result there has been massive population decline, although there seems to be some slight recovery in these areas (IUCN 2022).

Populations of this species, especially on the northern border of its distribution, are threatened by disturbance from the release of fish in their breeding waters, which affects the larva (Noellert and Noellert 1992). Habitat loss is also a factor in the decline of this species; in addition to outright habitat destruction, changes affecting the microclimatic conditions (e.g., drainage) have had a negative impact on A. obstetricans (Gasc 1997).
","

","
Through a 2023 Bayesian analysis using previous samples from Maia-Carvalho et al. (2014) as well as new samples, the origins of some subspecies of A. obstetricans have been identified. In total, there are four subspecies: A. o. pertinax, A. o. obstetricans, A. o. boscai, and an unnamed taxon. Alytes obstetricans pertinax is the result of a hybridization event between Alytes almogavarii almogavarii and A. o. obstetricans. The mitochondrial sequences of A. o. boscai is more similar to A. o. obstetricans, indicating past hybridization between the two subspecies. In this same analysis, the species was shown to be sister to A. almogavarii, the two of which form a clade that is sister to the rest of the genus (Ambu et al. 2023).

This species was featured as News of the Week on 23 May 2022: 
Habitat loss or modification is the biggest threat to amphibians, which includes the introduction of non-native plants. Eucalyptus globulus trees have been introduced globally from its native Australia, and its negative effects on native species, including adult amphibians, have been documented. What about other stages? Iglesias-Carrasco et al. (2022) investigated with experiments on the effects of eucalypt leachates on tadpole behavior, morphology, growth, and immune response. Rana temporaria, Alytes obstetricans, and Pelophylax perezi tadpoles were raised in mesocosms with either native oak or exotic eucalypt leachates then exposed to predator cues. The authors found that while anti-predator responses were not significantly affected, tadpoles raised in eucalypt leachates were smaller and had weaker immune responses. Furthermore, the morphology of P. perezi tadpoles in eucalypt treatments were similar to the stress morphology of other species, which may affect the tadpolesâ€™ ability to escape predators and jump in later development. Although species varied in responses, these results indicate that the poor nutrient content and high toxicity of Eucalyptus have strong impacts at critical early stages of frog development. Further studies are needed to fully understand the long-term fitness consequences of Eucalyptus monocultures. (Written by Ann Chang)

Barbourula busuangensis is a large, heavy-bodied, highly aquatic frog found in the fast-moving waters of mountain streams on the Philippine islands of Busuanga and Palawan.  Adaptations to this life-style include a dorsoventrally flattened body shape, dorsally placed nostrils and eyes, robust and muscular hind limbs and forelimbs, and webbed digits on the forelimbs as well as the hind limbs.  The body is covered with numerous very fine warts that increase in size laterally from the midline.  This species is dark in color, from dark green to black, with faint lighter green blotches and crossbars on the hind limbs.  There is no external tympanum.

Taylor and Noble (1924)
 described the Philippine Flat-headed frog, B. busuangensis, as a new genus and species from a single preserved specimen.  The authors noted the similarity of this species to some of the most basal lineages of anurans, and especially members of the genus Bombina.  Currently, Barbourula is grouped with Bombina in the Bombinatoridae (Ford and Cannatella 1993). 
  Iskandar (1978)
 described a second species of the genus, Barbourula kalimantanensis, from neighboring Borneo.





","
B. busuangensis is a rare and poorly known species of frog first described from the Philippine island of Busuanga, the largest island of the Calamianes island group (Taylor and Noble 1924).
  The species has since been reported only a handful of times in the scientific literature (Myers 1943; Inger 1954; Brown and Alcala 1970; Alcala and Brown 1987).
  In 1961, a survey of the herpetofauna of the Philippines produced the first record of B. busuangensis from the island of Palawan (Brown and Alcala 1970),
 reinforcing the association of this species with a fauna more similar to that of Borneo than the rest of the Philippine archipelago (Taylor and Noble 1924).
  This impression was reinforced by the later discovery of B. kalimantanensis on northern Borneo (Iskandar 1978).

Within Palawan and Busuanga, B. busuangensis is restricted to clean, cool, mountain streams in undisturbed forest.  In these streams, this species can be found floating at the water surface with only its eyes and nostrils visible, or amongst rocks in fast flowing water (Alcala and Brown 1987).
  However, this species is very wary and quick to hide underneath submerged rocks when disturbed, which may explain why this frog remains so elusive.





","
Many aspects of the biology of this interesting species of frog are poorly known and remain largely unstudied because of its extreme rarity and wariness.  Most of the basic facts of the ecology and life history of B. busuangensis are still a mystery.  Perhaps the most obvious gap is the still unknown reproductive mode of this species.  Most amphibians pass through a larval stage (tadpole) and undergo metamorphosis as they develop from embryo to adult.  However, tadpoles of B. busuangensis have never been discovered.  Additionally, Inger (1954)
 noted that eggs in the ovaries of gravid females were large, unpigmented, and few in number.  This egg morphology and coloration (or lack thereof) lead Brown and Alcala (1983)
 to speculate further that this species may have a specialized mode of reproduction, such as direct development.  If true, this would be a remarkable discovery.  To investigate this possibility, Alcala and Brown (1987)
 attempted to induce breeding in the laboratory.  Unfortunately, these experiments were unsuccessful and the method of reproduction of B. busuangensis remains a mystery.





","

","
The secretive nature, low abundance, and strict habitat requirements of B. busuangensis mean that very little is known about the ecology and natural history of this species.  In fact, the difficulty associated with finding this species on Busuanga Island led Taylor and Noble to remark in their original description that the species may have already been nearing extinction almost eighty years ago (Taylor and Noble 1924).
  Today, the known range of B. busuangensis has been extended to include the larger island of Palawan, greatly increasing the area of suitable habitat for this species compared to what was thought by Taylor and Noble.  However, the strict habitat requirements of the frog mean that its future is still in peril due to the increasing destruction of lowland forest on Palawan associated with logging and agriculture (Infante et al. 2002).  Populations of B. busuangensis on Busuanga Island may be in particular danger because of the low availability of suitable habitat and the increasing pressure from migrant settlers in the form of pollution and habitat modification (Banks et al. 1999).

Tympanic membrane absent. Transversal processes of the vertebra sacralis notably widened. Pupil of the eye triangular. Skin tuberculate. Dorsal tubercles rounded rather than coming to a point. Dorsal surface dark-grayish to almost black, with large dark spots. In pools with opaque water, a sandy bottom and scarce riparian vegetation, the toads sometimes possess a bright-green dorsal coloration with scarce dark-green spots. Belly red or orange, with large bluish-black spots and numerous white points. On the belly, the bright coloration does not exceed the dark coloration in area.

The species inhabits Central and Eastern Europe. The Central European part of the range is divided by the Carpathian Mountains. The glacial refugia of B. bombina are supposed to be in the steppes bordering the Black and Caspian seas. The western margin of the range runs approximately by Germany (Schlezwig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Sachsen-Anhalt, Dresden and Gorlitz), Czech Republic, Northeast Austria, Eastern Yugoslavia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and Western Turkey. The northern margin of the range runs from the area southwest to the Swedish province of Skane through Denmark to the Baltic Sea through Byelorussia and Central European Russia to Preuralia (Bashkiria) and Urals (Chelyabinsk Province). The southern margin of the range seems to be limited with the mountains of Balkan Peninsula; however, it occurs in Western Turkey (Anatolia: Sakarya River). The toad is known from the Northern Crimea. In the south of the European part of the former Soviet Union it occurs mainly in river valleys, including those in Precaucasia and Precaspian region. Then the range extends through the Southern Urals to the Northern Kazakhstan.

The toad inhabits zones of steppe, forest steppe, broad-leaved and mixed forests consisting of different species of trees. In the forest steppe and steppe zones, B. bombina inhabits bushlands, forests and wetlands in floodplains, covered with dense vegetation. It inhabits also open landscapes, using drainage channels as pathways for dispersal. At the southeastern margin of its range, the species lives in permanent freshwater bodies in river valleys surrounded by an arid saline landscape. It is primarily an aquatic animal living in shallow stagnant lakes, ponds, swamps, peatbogs, ditches, flooded rice fields and quarries. Sometimes the toad inhabits semi-flowing waters: springs, irrigation channels, rivers and stream pools. In some areas, however, it seems to live almost entirely in stagnant water bodies. As a rule, the water must be clear. In the Carpathian region, B. bombina lives in wetlands with clearer water than the congeneric B. variegata. However, near the southern margin of the range, in Southeastern Ukraine and Krasnodar Region of Russia, the toad often occurs in chemically polluted waters: settling and sedimentation reservoirs, rice fields, polluted ponds in settlements and cities etc.







","
In the West Europe this species is significantly declining or extinct in many areas. There it largely depends on conservation of wetland habitats. However, over large areas of the European part of the f. USSR, the Fire-Bellied Toad is a common or numerous amphibian. For example, in Byelorussia its proportion averages 0.4-3.4% of all amphibians. At suitable sites in lowland Ukraine, the toad's abundance reaches 200 individuals per a hectare of pond surface. In central European Russia, the toad's density reaches 20000, and in Precaucasia varies within 0.6-26453 individuals per the same square.

The toads prefer relatively warm conditions: they are active at +10 - +30oC, usually +18 - +20oC. Active individuals are found in the daytime, but the maximum calling by males occurs at dusk, whereas during windy or cold weather toad activity decreases. Fire-Bellied Toads stay in the water or near the shore; terrestrial migrations occur mainly at high air humidity, as a rule at night.

Hibernation occurs from the end of September or October (sometimes the beginning of November) to late March or April. The toad hibernates in the mud on the bottom of water bodies or on land. The breeding season extends from May to the end of summer. During this time, male vocalizes floating on the water surface, with body flattened. Sometimes he is able to call from under the water. Amplexus is pelvic. The clutch contains 80-300 eggs, sometimes more, deposited in portions. Embryonic and larval development takes 2-2.5 months. Metamorphosis extends from the second half of June to the end of September. As a rule, it peaks in July-August. Recently metamorphosed toadlets stay in the water and near the shore. Sexual maturity is attained in the 2nd-4th year of life, longevity in nature reaches at least 12 years.

Tadpoles consume mainly algae and higher plants, lower animals frequently are eaten. Newly metamorphosed toadlets prey mainly on insects (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera), as do adults, which consume mainly insects. More than half of their diet of adults may consist of aquatic invertebrates, but terrestrial animals are also numerous. Variation in the proportion of aquatic prey in different samples reflects the extent of terrestrialism the toad in different landscapes and seasons. During the breeding season, feeding is not stopped.

When faced with a potential predator, B. bombina exhibits a defensive posture called the unkenreflex. It turns over and curves its bright belly upward, covering the eyes with its palms. Otherwise, it may not turn over but instead curve its body downward, lift up the head, and curve the extremities showing the bright spots on its flanks and on the ventral surface of the extremities. Despite the venomous skin secretions in the Fire-Bellied Toad, many vertebrates regularly consume its adults and juveniles. For example, up to 25% of the diet of Night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) in Ukraine may consist of Fire-bellied toads.

Destruction of wetlands is the most serious threat to populations. This led to decline or extinction of this species from many areas of the West and Central Europe. Such phenomena are known from Sweden, Germany, Denmark and many other countries. In the former USSR such phenomena were recorded locally, mainly in surroundings of cities, near enterprises, in agricultural landscapes where artificial fertilizers were used, etc. In this region the species is numerous or common and not threatened.







","
As noted above, the destruction and pollution of habitats are main threats for the species populations. The Fire-Bellied Toad is rare in cities. Nevertheless, at the southern margin of the range (Precaucasia) the toad inhabits even polluted wetlands, such as sedimentation reservoirs, rice fields etc. Some kinds of human activity  are profitable for the toad: it uses drainage channels as pathways for dispersal.

Diagnosis: Bombina microdeladigitora is similar to B. maxima, but differentiated from the latter species by slight amount of webbing in the toes, black spines on the throat and chest being scattered in small groups, and black being the dominant color on the ventral side. Conversely, B. maxima has fully webbed toes and its ventral side is equally variegated in black and red. 

Description: Body length of an adult male B. microdeladigitora holotype was recorded at 77 mm. The head is broader than long, tympana are hidden, and the arms are relatively long and fingers short with distinct fringes at their base, forming web-like structures. The dorsal skin of the head, body, and limbs is very rough and covered in warts. The snout and lateral sides of the head, body and limbs are much smoother. Four elongated warts form an X mark on the shoulder region (Liu et al. 1960).

Coloration: When alive, the dorsal side is greenish with dark black to brown marks along scattered warts, which can be both small and large. Black vertical bars mark the jaws and one wide black bar marks each thigh. A black color dominates the ventrum with fewer orange-red marks (Liu et al. 1950). 

Coloration in Preservative: After preservation, the greenish color changes to dark grey and the brown and orange-red turns to white (Liu et al. 1960).

","
B. microdeladigitora was first discovered in the Yunnan province of China, and collected at an altitude of 2,240 m from Huand-tsiao-ling, Ching-tung, Yunnan.  It is also known from the Hubei Province of China. The first Vietnam record found east of the Red River was in 2004, when an adult male was found in a mud filled tree hole at 1900 m on Mt. Tay Con Linh II (Bain and Truong 2004). B. microdeladigitora has also been recorded in the Hengduan Mountains of China at elevations ranging from 1200 m to 2600 m (Fu 2006). Records of B. microdeladigitora were taken from Phong Nha - Ke Band National Park, Truong Son, central Vietnam. However, this occurrence still requires voucher-based identification (Hendrix et al. 2008).

","

","
Bombina microdeladigitora was found to secrete two different serine protease inhibitors from its skin, and sequence analysis revealed that all serine protease inhibitors from five species of Bombina share highly conserved genes (Lu et al. 2007)
Phylogenetic Relationships: The genus Bombina is currently divided into three major clades: the European and Korean groups, which form a sister relationship, and the Indo-Malay clade to which B. microdeladigitora belongs (Zheng et al. 2009). Due to the low levels of genetic, morphological and karyological differences, it has been suggested that B. microdeladigitora and B. fortinuptialis be reassigned as subspecies of B. maxima (Yu et al. 2007).

Tympanic membrane absent. Transversal processes of the vertebra sacralis notably widened. Pupil of the eye triangular. No male resonators. Skin tuberculate. Dorsal skin with very high, quite acute tubercles. The tubercles are the highest among the three species of Bombina in the former USSR. The tops of the tubercles are sometimes so rough that they feel like short needles. Belly is smooth, with small tubercles present only near the cloaca. Dorsal surface brown gray to gray-greenish or bright green with dark spots. Belly red or red-orange to yellow with dark spots. Bright spots fused forming an irregular pattern. The bright coloration exceeds the dark coloration in area on the belly. The male differs from the female by having nuptial pads on the first and second fingers. 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Bombina orientalis inhabits Northeastern China (provinces of Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang), Korea, Southern Japan (Tsushima and Kiushiu islands), and the Khabarovsk and Primorye regions in Russia. Part of the range in the Lianoning Province, China, seems to be isolated from the other parts. The northernmost locality is Arsenievo Village, Nanai District, Khabarovsk Region in Russia (ca. 48o40'N, 137o12'E). 
 
The species lives in various landscapes, as a rule, in mixed coniferous - broad-leaved forests. However, it often occurs in other habitats, including spruce, pine or leafed forests, open meadows, river valleys, swampy bushlands, etc. Bombina orientalis uses different types of bodies of water with stagnant (sometimes running) water: lakes, ponds, swamps, streams, springs, ditches, puddles etc. At the end of summer, the species can be found on land at distances up to few hundred meters from water. 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Bombina orientalis is one of the most common amphibians in the central part of the range, comprising a large proportion (to 29%) of their total number. The population density at breeding sites reaches 8.0 specimens per square meter. However, the toad becomes rarer northwards. In Khabarovsk Region, at the northern margin of its range, the toad is a rare species, known by only a few individuals. 
 
The toad hibernates from late September - October to late April - May, on land: in rotten trees, heaps of stones, leaves, in groups of 1-6 individuals. Sometimes hibernation occurs in streams. Reproduction occurs in May - mid-August. The reproductive period is very long within each population because different females deposit eggs at a different time. The process of egg deposition is gradual: there are no peaks in spawning intensity. The male mating call resembles that of the Fire-Bellied Toad (Bombina bombina). Breeding pairs are formed randomly. Amplexus is pelvic. The clutch contains 38-257 eggs deposited in portions of 3-45 eggs. The interval between deposition of subsequent portions is 7-10 days. Probably, females are capable of depositing multiple clutches. Embryonic and larval development take about 2 months, and hatching takes place usually from early June to late July. Tadpoles complete metamorphosis usually by the end of August - late September. Maximum longevity is estimated as 20 years. 
 
Larvae consume detritus, various algae, fungi, higher plants, protozoans and, in smaller amounts, Oligochaeta, Naiadomorpha, Rotatoria and Microcrustacea(Daphniidae, Sididae, Chydoridae, Ostracoda). The tadpole diet widens during ontogeny because of an increase in plant and animal diversity. Preying upon of terrestrial invertebrates (Acarina, Collembola) starts before the completion of metamorphosis while the toadlets still have a small tail rudiment. Adult food consists of terrestrial invertebrates including worms, molluscs and insects. The proportion of aquatic invertebrates (Gastropoda, Notonectidae, Dytiscidae, etc.) varies among populations. 
 
Some predatory birds and mammals are known as natural enemies of this species. The defensive posture of adult individuals is similar to that of the European Fire-Bellied Toad (B. bombina).

Tympanic membrane absent. Transversal processes of the vertebra sacralis notably widened. Pupil of the eye triangular. No male resonators. Skin tuberculate. Dorsal tubercles acute and relatively high. Ventral tubercles small and scarce in number. Dorsal surface dark-olive, with small dark spots. Belly yellow, sometimes orange, with large dark spots, white points absent or rare. On the belly, the bright coloration exceeds the dark coloration in area. The inner surface of the leg is covered with bright spots which are large and fused on the inner surface of the thigh. Tips of toes bright. In contrast with the female, the male has nuptial pads on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd fingers and, during the breeding season, on the inner surface of the forearm. Majority of these characters separate B. variegata from B. bombina. However, morphological characters probably have unequal taxonomic value and only their combined use may be effective for practical identification.







","
The species inhabits Central and Southern Europe except for the southwestern part. The western margin of the range runs through Germany (Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia) to The Netherlands (Limburg Province), Belgium and France in the south. The species lives in Switzerland and Italy (a relic population occurs on Etna Mountain, Sicilia). In Greece, the species lives southwards to Peloponnes Peninsula. The northern margin of the range runs from Germany to Czech Republic, Southern Poland, Western Ukraine (Carpathians), Romania and Eastern Bulgaria. Several subspecies are recognized. Bombina variegata variegata inhabits the main part of the range, B. variegata kolombatovici lives in Yugoslavia (Dalmatia and Montenegro), B. variegata pachypus in Italia, B. variegata scabra in Montenegro, Albania, Greece and Bulgaria.

There is a contact zone with the related species, the Fire-Bellied Toad (Bombina bombina). This zone extends over the Southern Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Western Ukraine.

Bombina variegata lives mainly in foothills and mountains: in coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests, bushlands and meadows, floodplains, grasslands etc. At low elevations the toad lives in deciduous forests whereas in highlands it inhabits coniferous forests, highland glades and the upper forest margins. It uses various types of water bodies, including lakes, ponds, swamps, rivers and stream pools (sometimes streams with swift current), springs etc. Its requirements to water quality are relatively low. The toad occurs even in highly polluted wetlands, even waters with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and salts.








","
The Yellow-Bellied Toad is usually not a rare amphibian. Its population density in some suitable sites is higher than one specimen per few square meters, up to one specimen per 0.02 m2. In the Carpathians, it is the most common amphibian species inhabiting the broadest range of habitats.

Hibernation begins at the end of September - beginning of October and ends in March - May, depending on elevation. The toads overwinter in burrows, holes under stones and logs. In thermal springs, the toads may be active in winter. Reproduction starts 5-10 days after entering the water and extends to August. Amplexus is pelvic. Amplectant specimens and the spawn are often observed at the same time and in wetlands where conspecific tadpoles undergo their metamorphosis. Along with a wide diversity of breeding pool types, this trait increases the variety of habitats used by the toad populations. Sometimes heavy rains in summer may be followed by intensive spawning of B. variegata in small wetlands. The male mating call is similar to that of B. bombina, but is quieter and higher. The clutch consists of 45-100 (or more) eggs deposited in portions.

In contrast to B. bombina, the Yellow-Bellied Toad eats mainly terrestrial arthropods. This composition of diet corresponds with its more terrestrial habits. Aquatic invertebrates, e.g. Gammaridae, are eaten mostly on the stream banks. The diet changes with age during the postmetamorphic period of life and includes an increase in the selection of larger prey. However, no age changes are known in the proportions of aquatic and terrestrial prey in the diet.







","

","
During the last 10-20 years anthropogenic pressure has led to the extinction of B. variegata from at least 13 localities in the Zakarpatskaya and Lvov Provinces of Ukraine. Destruction of natural habitats and urbanization leads to population declines.







","
Evidently, anthropogenic influences are more important in the toad's population declines than natural biotic factors. Nevertheless, the species is common in human neighborhood and occurs even in wetlands highly polluted by humans. It lives there not only in the countryside but also in some urban forest parks, using artificial lakes and ponds. This is related to its opportunistic habits and high tolerance to pollution of environment.

This species was featured in news of the week 30 January 2023:
Some amphibians are able to persist in human-modified habitats, including within cities and intensively managed lands. Which mechanisms allow persistence in such environments? Cayuela et al. (2022) conducted a comprehensive analysis of mark-recapture studies of Yellow-bellied Toad (Bombina variegata) populations across a range of anthropic habitats. These toads breed in early-succession ponds and small pools of natural or anthropic origin. Life history traits can change along the gradient from natural to anthropic habitats according to two demographic scenarios. In the first scenario, the risk of adult mortality decreases with anthropization, associated with concomitant decreases in predation and parasitism rates. In the alternative scenario, increased exposure to contaminants, invasive species, ecological mismatches and other processes promote higher adult mortality risk in human-modified habitats. In this scenario, increased recruitment can compensate for increased adult mortality. Cayuela and collaborators estimated adult recruitment, adult survival, lifespan, and senescence rate from 67 populations of the yellow-bellied toads across western Europe. They convincingly show that toads in anthropogenic habitats have lower adult survival, shorter lifespan, and accelerated senescence than toads in natural habitats. Compensatory recruitment indeed occurs in anthropogenic habitats, where average adult recruitment is 93% higher than in natural habitats. Increased human land disturbance might promote creation of breeding habitats conducive to higher adult recruitment. These findings suggest the important role of human disturbance for maintaining populations of amphibians using early-succession habitats. (Written by A. Catenazzi)

Brachycephalus ephippium is a small frog with adults ranging from 12.5 mm to 19.7 mm in snout-vent length.  Although tiny, it has a robust body, with short legs.  The skin color is bright yellow to orange.  The iris is completely black. Digit number is reduced, with three fingers and three functional toes.  Phalanges are also reduced, in both number and size, so that fingers and toes are both shorter and smaller.  The terminal phalanges are T-shaped.  A dermal bony shield is present and ossified dorsal to the backbone.  No teeth are present on the maxillary or premaxillaries. (Pombal, 2003).  
 

","
Pumpkin Toadlets are found in Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira in southeastern Brazil. They occur in montane Atlantic coastal forest, from 750 m to 1200 m in elevation. These frogs inhabit leaf litter on the forest floor  
(Pombal et al., 1994).
","
These frogs are diurnal during the rainy season.  Generally they walk about on the leaf litter, but will find a low perch if the humidity approaches 100%.  They clean themselves by wiping their head and body with their limbs. During the dry season, they remain under logs or leaf litter (Pombal, 2003).   
 
Males are highly territorial during the rainy season.  When another frog approaches, the male frog signals both by vocalization and by moving an arm up and down in front of its own eye.  If the intruder is a male and remains, the male frog embraces and wrestles the intruder, pushing it away.  Presentation of mirrors to male frogs elicited visual displays in almost all cases, and rarely, attacks, but no vocalizations.  Presentation of mirrors to two female frogs resulted in a visual display by one of the females  
(Pombal et al., 1994).   
 
 Breeding takes place during the rainy season.  Advertisement calls consist of a continuous series of buzzes lasting two to six minutes.  The call begins with the first notes having five or six pulses, and ending with notes that have as many as fifteen pulses.  However, most of the notes have ten pulses and an almost constant pitch.  Calling males elevate their body, displaying a ""high posture"".  Visual signals may be more important than vocal signals in this species since the vocalization appears to be softer in volume than background environmental noise (Pombal et al., 1994).  
 
The male grasps the female and walks behind her as she selects a site for egg deposition in the leaf litter or under a log.  Initially amplexus is inguinal (around the waist), with the male then moving forward and changing to an almost axillary position (just below the armpits).  Females lay up to five large, yellowish white eggs over a period of about half an hour.  When the males leave the mating site, the females roll the eggs about using their hind feet. Dirt adheres to the egg surfaces, helping to camouflage them. The females then leave the eggs unattended. Development is direct (lacking the tadpole stage), with hatching of miniature toadlets occurring in about two months. The newly hatched toadlets still have a vestigial tail  
(Pombal, 2003).  
   
Pumpkin Toadlets are active foragers. The adult diet consists of small arthropods, primarily collembolans (springtails), but also including mites and insect larvae (Pombal, 2003).
","

","
Originally this species was reported as not threatened since its range is within protected areas in the Brazilian Atlantic coastal forest (Pombal, 2003). IUCN Red List's 2008 assessment for this species is Least Concern; however, Bornschein et al (2019) analyzed the Brachycephalus species using the IUCN Red List criteria with newer information and concluded this species should be listed as Vulnerable (criteria B1ab(i,iii)) based on reduced range and known sites as well as degraded habitat and ongoing threats.

 Fluorescence is a well known phenomenon in marine organisms, which only recently has been found in terrestrial vertebrates; the first report of fluorescence in amphibians was described in the lymph and skin glands in Boana punctatus and B. atlantica (Taboada et al. 2017). Goutte et al. (2019) reports another amphibian fluorescence: this time in the dermal bones of two species of pumpkin toadlets, Brachycephalus ephippium and B. pitanga. When exposed to intense UV-light, they found the intensity of fluorescence increases with the maturity of the frog as the epithelial layer co-ossifies with the bones of the head and back. Given earlier findings (Goutte et al. 2017) that these two species were unable to hear their own advertisement calls, and instead rely on visual cues, such as hand-waving and mouth-gaping for mating, they hypothesize that the fluorescence in these species may be used to enhance intraspecific visual communication. However, analysis of Brachycephalus vision is needed to test this hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis is that the fluorescence enhances aposematic warnings of the toadlets' toxicity to predators that see fluorescence in natural light, such as birds and spiders (Written by Ann T. Chang).

Brachycephalus pitanga is a diminutive species of frog, as are all other members of the genus Brachycephalus.  Snout-vent length of adult males ranges from 10.8 to 12.1 mm.  Females are larger, with snout-vent length ranges from 12.6 to 14 mm. The skin on the head and back is co-ossified to the skull and axial skeleton.  The head is as wide as it is long.  It is slightly narrower than the stocky body but composes 39% of total snout-vent length.  The inter-nostral distance is approximately a third of the head width.  The snout is rounded in shape when viewed laterally or dorsally.  It is short: its length is about the diameter of the eye.  The nostrils project noticeably from the head and point backwards and outwards.  There is weak concavity of the loreal region and the canthal ridge is weakly defined.  The mouth is approximately C-shaped. The eye protrudes slightly from the orbit and is 25% of head length (as measured from the tip of the snout to the corner of the jaw).  The eye diameter is two-thirds the interorbital diameter. The eye-nostril distance is equal to the interorbital diameter.  There are no clearly extended vocal sacs and no tympanum (Alves et al. 2009).

Like other members of the genus, B. pitanga lack one or more phalanges in the hands and feet and have a reduced number of digits. Brachycephalus pitanga has slender forearms, which are roughly the same length as each humerus.  The hand is unwebbed.  The middle two fingers (digits II and III on the manus) are well developed, but digit II is comparatively more rounded and shorter.  Digits I and IV are extremely reduced and appear as bumps on the side of the hand rather than projecting fingers.  The digits and hands lack tubercles. The hind limbs are short; the femur region is significantly thicker than any other limb portion.  Thigh length is roughly one third of snout-vent length, and the tibia is about 10% shorter than the thigh.  There is one pronounced metatarsal tubercle on the foot and There is little to no webbing. Toes I and V are not visible externally.  Toes II, III and IV are successively longer; Toe II is the shortest and has a more rounded tip than the others 
(Alves et al. 2009).

Skin texture is an important and distinctive characteristic of B. pitanga.  The head, dorsum, and lateral and ventrolateral surfaces are all coarse and superficially bumpy, as is the area immediately surrounding the cloaca.  The ventral surfaces of the body and legs lack this granular texture and instead are smooth (Alves et al. 2009).

Brachycephalus pitanga is distinguished from several congeneric species by the presence of co-ossified skin on the head and dorsum.  Brachycephalus brunneus, B. ferruginus, B. izecksohni, B. pernix, and B. pombali all have smooth skin without calcification.  The presence of irregular red splotches and mottling on the dorsum distinguishes B. pitanga from B. alipioi, B. ephippium, B. nodoterga and B. vertebralis, all of which lack red coloration.  Brachycephalus pitanga (and all other aforementioned species) differs from B. didactylus and B. hermogenesi in having a snout with a rounded profile when viewed dorsally.  Brachycephalus didactylus and B. hermogenesi instead have pointed snouts and are further identified by their brown coloration (versus orange and red color of B. pitanga) (Alves et al. 2009). Brachycephalus pitanga and numerous congeneric species have hyperossified skulls.  Brachycephalus ephippium has a shield of bone extending down the back, though B. pitanga does not (Clemente-Carvalho et al. 2009). The advertisement call of males of B. pitanga can has longer call durations and lower dominant frequency compared to those of B. hermogenesi and B. ephippium (Oliveira and Haddad 2017).

In life, this species is typically orange, with irregular red splotches and mottling on the dorsum that are distinctive and can cover a significant portion of the back. It also possesses dorsal, lateral and ventral dark brown dots and speckles.  In some adults, coloration ranges from almost entirely orange to almost entirely red; juveniles are typically darker than adults (Alves et al. 2009).

In preservative, the coloration fades to  off-white in color, with amber or orange markings replacing the contrasting red patterning and dark spots that were present in life (Alves et al. 2009).

There is relatively little variation in adult size or morphology among adult B. pitangaâ€”roughly a couple millimeters in snout-vent length, but with consistent proportions and head anatomy, which are diagnostically useful.  The coloration is variable, ranging from almost entirely orange to almost entirely red, and coloration is darker in juveniles (Alves et al. 2009).

Brachycephalus pitanga occurs in the Serra do Mar of south/southeastern Brazil.  The original species description referenced specimens from NÃºcleo Santa VÃ­rginia in the Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar reserve in the region of SÃ£o LuÃ­s do Pairatinga and in montane forests in Fazenda CapricÃ³rnio in the Ubatuba region, in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil (S 23Â°21'58'', W 44Â°50'89' ).  Frogs are found in and atop leaf litter.  The species occurs between 600 and 1800 meters elevation, and its range is not believed to overlap with that of other members of its genus (Alves et al. 2009; AraÃºjo et al. 2012).

Brachycephalus pitanga is active during the day and has terrestrial habits.  It primarily inhabits leaf litter, but it has been found up to 1 m above the ground (Oliveira and Haddad 2017).  

Activity is reduced during the dry season, when males call primarily in the morning during misty conditions or precipitation.  Males have also been observed to call throughout the rest of the year.  In its restricted range, B. pitanga can occur at very high densities of up to 208 frogs per 100 m2 (Alves et al. 2009).  When relative humidity is high (> 80%), males will call from atop the leaf litter; when the humidity is less than 80%, they instead call from within the litter (Oliveira and Haddad 2017).

The advertisement call of B. pitanga consists of approximately 11 low-intensity pulsed notes emitted at a rate of roughly 60 Hz, with a frequency of about 4.9 kHz.  Territorial calls, by contrast, have a slightly higher frequency (~ 5.3 kHz) and a similar pulsing pattern.  Three other types of calls have been documented (Oliveira and Haddad 2017).   However, B. pitanga (and the closely related B. ephippium) are thought to be unable to hear their own calls, due to incompletely developed inner ears.  Both are thought to instead rely upon visual communication.  Though calling would be expected to be selected against if it doesnâ€™t serve a purpose, it may have been retained because these frogs are toxic (only B. ephippium has been directly studied for toxicity) and likely have few predators (Pires et al. 2005; Goutte et al. 2017). 

Brachycephalus pitanga utilizes aposematic coloration. Similarly to many other Brachycephalus species, they are toxic; their skin contains tetrodotoxins (RebouÃ§as et al. 2019; Pires et al. 2005; Goutte et al. 2017).

In response to being captured, some B. pitanga open their mouth, which may be a defensive behavior (2009).  In territorial displays, B. pitanga males wave their hands in front of their face, similar to the motion which they use to clean themselves of soil particles (Oliveira and Haddad 2017). 

Mating is hypothesized to occur in the rainy season.  Males are territorial and will engage in physical combat with encroaching males (Oliveira and Haddad 2015; Oliveira and Haddad 2017).

Brachycephalus pitanga is a direct-developing species (i.e., it has no free-living larval stage and no post-hatching metamorphosis).  This is broadly true of all members of the family Brachycephalidae.  Species in this family lay eggs on the ground or in trees (B. pitanga is not arboreal, so presumably the former is true of this species) and have axillary or sometimes inguinal amplexus (Hedges et al. 2008).

Brachycephalus pitanga actively forages for a wide range of prey including mites (Acari), springtails (Collembola), true bugs (Hemiptera), flies (Diptera), ants (Formicidae), beetles (Coleoptera), and larvae belonging to various taxonomic groups.  The diversity of prey items is greater in the wet season, and prey size is, on average, larger during this part of the year as well.  Generally, mites and springtails are favored, while ants appear to be avoided.  The diet of B. pitanga is quite similar to those of its congeners.  Males feed less during breeding season (Oliveira and Haddad 2015).

Brachycephalus pitanga and B. ephippium possess highly fluorescent dermal bones on the dorsum and the head, which are covered by a very thin layer of skin.  Peak fluorescence occurs when exposed to light of 365 - 385 nm wavelength (invisible to naked human eye).  The fluorescent tissue occurs in dorsal patches and is present in both males and females.  However, juveniles whose skin has not yet co-ossified do not fluoresce.  Fluorescence may function in intra- or interspecific signaling (possibly aposematically) though this hasnâ€™t been tested (Goutte et al. 2019).

","
Currently IUCN has not yet assessed the conservation status of B. pitanga. Although, B. pitanga's current population health may belie vulnerability, the species has been deemed to be of little conservation concern given its documented distribution and abundance.  While locally dense, they have a small and restricted range and are susceptible to habitat loss and disturbance.  Populations are also altitudinally and climactically restricted, so climate change may pose a threat.  These same attributes have led to high vulnerability of close relatives (Bornschein et al. 2019). Following Bornschein et al (2019), this species is listed provisionally as Least Concern.

There is conflicting evidence for the risk posed to B. pitanga by chytrid fungus.  One study has found that the symptoms of infection from the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are minimal and sublethal (Bovo et al. 2016).  However, a second, more recent study found that spillover of Bd from aquatic-breeding frogs was in fact highly lethal and could pose a major threat to B. pitanga populations (Becker et al. 2019).  Thus, it is reasonable to act under the conservative assumption that Bd poses a real threat to this species of frog with regard to conservation efforts.

Brachycephalus pitanga occurs in areas protected as part of Parque Estadual Serra do Mar (Sobre n.d.; Alves et al. 2009).

Within Brachycephalus, B. pitanga is most closely related to B. vertebralis, B. nodoterga, and B. toby, according to a molecular study that evaluated three mitochondrial genes, Cytb, 12SrRNA, and 16S rRN, and two nuclear loci, Rag-1 and Tyr. Bayesian Inference was used to create a phylogeny, however gene 16S was excluded because they did not have the S16 sequence for B. hermogenesi. The results indicate that B. alipioi and B. hermogenesi belong in a clade sister to the clade consisting of  B. pitanga, B. vertebralis, B. nodoterga, and B. toby (Clemente-Carvalho et al. 2011).  However, the structure of the clade formed by these four species is not well-resolved.

The genus Brachycephalus is most closely related to the genus Ischnocnema.  Together, these two genera comprise the family Brachycephalidae.  This family is sister to the diverse clade consisting of Craugastoridae and Strabomantidae (Hedges et al. 2008).  At least 17 species of Brachycephalus are known (AraÃºjo et al. 2012).

Brachycephalus comes from the Greek words: â€œbrachysâ€ meaning â€œshortâ€ and â€œkephaleâ€ meaning â€œheadâ€ (Hedges et al. 2008).  

The specific name â€œpitangaâ€ comes from the language of the indigenous Tupi-Guarani people and means â€œreddishâ€, in reference to the dorsal coloration of the frog.  Pitanga is also a name used for a widespread native species of plant, Eugenia uniflora, that produces a red fruit (Alves et al. 2009).
The family Brachycephalidae occurs widely in southern and southeastern Brazil and northern Argentina in forests along the Atlantic coast (Hedges et al. 2008).

The holotype is stored at Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Alves et al. 2009).

In diverse wildlife communities, exchange of pathogens and symbiotic bacteria among host species influences disease dynamics. The aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has wiped out tropical frog communities, with unresolved declines even in terrestrial-dwelling frogs. Becker et al (2019) studied communities of tropical Brazilian frogs to explore spread of pathogenic and potentially beneficial microbes to the disease-susceptible terrestrial-dwelling pumpkin toadlet Brachycephalus pitanga. Toadlets acquired lethal fungal infections, but rarely acquired protective bacteria, from naturally infected aquatic frogs, with disease causing imbalances in host symbiotic bacteria. Our results suggest that pathogen transmission from mildly infected aquatic frogs may lead to death and disruption of symbiotic bacteria in vulnerable terrestrial species (Written by Gui Becker).

Anaxyrus americanus has a short, stout body, with a short broad head bearing large parotoid glands and having a broadly circular snout.  The back is covered with different-sized warts and the venter is granular. There are three or four pairs of dark spots down the back, each accompanied by one large wart.  Eyes are prominent. The arms and legs are tubular and warty. They are generally olive in color, with a brown crest  (Wright and Wright 1949).  
 Males are roughly 54-85 mm in length. The back, sides and tympana are a dull citrine color with olive-citrine or yellow olive color on their hind legs and forelegs. The pectoral region is covered with scattered black spots, and these spots occur over the entire venter except for the throat and the center of the posterior venter. There is some apricot-yellow color across the arm insertion. The pupil is rimmed with citron yellow  (Wright and Wright 1949).  
 Females are roughly 56-110 mm in length. The back is a light brownish or buffy olive. The bigger warts are on the back, and the warts are in the centers of buffy brown colored spots. There is a stripe down the middle of the back, of a deep-olive buff color, yellow, or vinaceous-fawn, that leads from parotoid to groin. In the center of the breast, there is a dark spot (Wright and Wright 1949).  
 

","
Anaxyrus americanus  can be found in Eastern North American, from the maritime provinces of Quebec and Ontario in Canada to Minnesota. Its range spans from the northern borders of the Gulf States, excluding Louisiana, and Texas. They can also be found in Arkansas, eastern Oaklahoma, and eastern Kansas (Schmidt 1953).  
 
Within Canada, A. americanus  can be found in Ungava, James Bay, and sometimes the coast of Hudson Bay. It also occurs from Prince Edward Island to East Manitoba, and has been introduced to parts of Newfoundland (Cook 1984). 
 
 During the periods where the toads are not reproducing, they live in within an area of approximately 100' x 100'. However, during the breeding period, they may move several thousand feet away.  
 

","
Anaxyrus americanus  lays its eggs between the months of April to July (Oliver 1955). The peak of the breeding season is usually late April (Wright and Wright 1949). Breeding sites are usually small ditches, small ponds, or slow, shallow streams (Johnson 1987). The male grasps the female behind her front legs, and she will begin laying her eggs (Johnson 1987). 
 
Clutch size is usually 4,000-8,000 eggs, in a single string. The eggs will incubate for about 3-12 days before hatching. The tadpoles are dark, almost black.  After the young toads metamorphose, they will migrate in mass numbers away from the water (Wright and Wright 1949).

A medium-sized toad. Distinguishing characters include a white or cream dorsal stripe and lack of cranial crest. This species has two known subspecies, Anaxyrus boreas boreas  and A. b. halophilus.  
A. b. boreas is dusky gray or greenish above with warts set in dark blotches, often mixed with a bit of rusty color. Males are usually less blotched with smoother skin and are smaller than females (Stebbins 1985). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Populations of A. b. halophilus  are found in California, western Nevada, and northern Baja California. Populations of A. b. boreas are found in southern Alaska, British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, northern California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. This toad frequents a wide variety of habitats such as desert streams, grasslands, woodlands, and mountain meadows, and can be found in or near a variety of water bodies (Stebbins 1985). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
This species is an explosive breeder.  Females deposit thousands of eggs in long strings, usually in shallow ponds.  These toads are nocturnal at low elevations and diurnal at higher elevations.  During the winter, A. boreas  buries itself 
 in loose soil or uses the burrow of a small mammal (Stebbins 1985).   

This species tends to walk rather than hop. Both males and females lack an advertisement call (Duellman and Trueb 1986) although they are known to have a release call (Brown and Littlejohn 1971).

","
UV-B radiation has been shown to cause reduced hatching success in 
 Oregon (Blaustein et al. 1994), but not in Colorado, although  
more investigation is needed (Corn 1998). 
Synergistic effects between UV-B and an alga,  Saprolegnia ferax , have 
 also been shown to cause reduced hatching success in  
Oregon (Kiesecker and Blaustein 1995). 
Vertucci and Corn (1993) found that acid precipitation may not be  
a major cause of the decline of A. b. boreas in Colorado, but more  
investigation of this problem is needed (Stebbins and Cohen 1995).   
A. boreas tends to lay its eggs in communal masses, and such communal egg masses have 
 been shown to be highly susceptible to infection with S. ferax  
(Kiesecker and Blaustein 1997). 
 
In the southern Rocky Mountains, translocation was tried for A. b. boreas.  The translocation projects failed;  A. b. boreas has been declining in that area for unknown reasons, for some time (Trenham 2001).

It has been known to occasionally hybridize with the Red-spotted Toad (Anaxyrus punctatus) and the Canadian toad (Anaxyrus hemiophrys) (Stebbins 1985).

How will increasing temperatures from the climate crisis impact amphibian aging and mortality? Despite its relevance to conservation, little data exists on the relationship between temperature and senescence in free-living animals. Cayuela et al. (2021) studied pairs of frogs from two families divided by 100 million years of evolutionary history to answer this: Rana luteiventris and R. temporaria (Ranidae) and Anaxyrus boreas and Bufo bufo (Bufonidae). The North American toads (Bufonidae) represented sampling along a climatic gradient, whereas the ranid frogs represented sampling from climatically contrasted sites. They found that actuarial senescence ratesâ€” i.e., the rate at which mortality increases with ageâ€” increased with the mean annual temperature experienced in all species. In all species but Anaxyrus boreas, increasing temperatures corresponded to decreasing lifespans. These relationships are presumably attributed to amphibians' increasing pace of life with increasing temperatures; they are active for longer periods, have a higher metabolism, lower mitochondrial efficiency, and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly. The impacts of increasing temperature on these frogs might be exacerbated by increasing evaporative water loss and influenced by genes involved in adapting amphibians to warmer conditions. In the ranids studied, the authors found increasing temperatures flipped sex differences in senescence rate in R. luteiventris but not R. temporaria. These results paint a grim picture for amphibians as global temperatures increase. Amphibian aging is expected to accelerate, with potential skewing sex ratios in some species.

Female and young may have many blotches on a pale background, paratoids are  
usually tan-colored, and the dorsal stripe is usually narrow or absent.  The  
males are yellow-green or dark olive above, with dark blotches virtually absent  
or reduced to small scattered flecks.  Males and females have pale throats  
(Stebbins 1985). 
 
The Yosemite toad can be distinguished from its closest relative, the Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), by its smaller size and lack of a vertebral stripe.

Endemic to the boreal zone of the central Sierra Nevada mountain range of  
California.  Found mostly at elevations of 8,500-10,000 ft (Karlstrom 1973).  Lives in wet, relatively open mountain meadows, never far from a permanent water source.

Anaxyrus canorus eggs often occur in clusters, unlike the eggs of the closely related A. boreas, which are always laid in long strings.  The eggs and larvae of A. canorus are extremely melanistic more so than those of A. boreas (Karlstrom 1962). 
 
Active in the daytime, especially during the breeding period, which starts as  
soon as shallow ice-melt pools form in the spring.  Breeding call is a  
mellow, sustained, musical trill of 10-20 or more notes. 

Eats a variety of insects, centipedes, and spiders, and is in turn preyed upon by garter snakes, birds, and by Rana muscosa, the Mountain yellow-legged frog (Karlstrom 1962).

This species has been declining rapidly and few populations remain.  At a Tioga Pass Meadow site, calling males dropped from a mean of 275.5 Â±83.1 between 1974 and 1978 to only 28 in 1982.  By 1990, 47% of 75 historic site in the species range lacked signs of the toads.  Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the decline, including increased predation, and disease caused by increased 
stress (such as ""red-leg"" disease, caused by Aeromonas hydrophilia infection).  Perhaps fluctuations in yearly snowfall disrupt 
reproduction, or even an increase in the chance of summer frost (causing high egg mortality).  Too little snowfall may cause their breeding ponds to dry up in 
the summer before tadpoles can metamorphose.  Too much snowfall may shorten the 
breeding season, preventing tadpoles from metamorphosing completely before the onset 
of cold fall weather.  It is possible that simply studying and 
handling the toads could contribute to  
their decline (Sherman and Morton 1993).   
Karltsrom (1962) suggested that vibrations caused by vehicles 
passing near breeding sites may reduce their  
reproductive efficiency. He also noticed that males ceased calling when vehicles drove by on nearby roads.  However, no relationship between distance from the  
nearest road and population declines has been found.  Also, habitat disturbance 
since the mid 1970's has been relatively light, suggesting that habitat destruction is 
not causing the decline (Sherman and Morton 1993).

The extent of sexual dichromatism in Anaxyrus canorus is rare among frogs (including other toads). However, the color differences between males and females do not seem to help the male toad distinguish between sexes, as many observations have been made of these toads attempting to mate with other species, even dead toads (Karlstrom 1962).

together with A. boreas (Western toad), A. exsul (Black toad), and A. nelsoni  
(Amargosa toad) (Blair 1964).

 This frog lives in arid to semi-arid land. Its range includes the central third of Texas and Oklahoma down to Mexico (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999).  
It can also be found in southeastern Colorado, ranging from Kanas to Zacatecas and from southeastern Arizona to eastern Texas (Degenhardt et al. 1996).  
","
A. debilis  breeds in shallow rain pools or intermittent streams. Toads gather at the breeding areas when the summer rains arrive, usually during the first week of July.  Males situate themselves in or around the ponds, and call to the females. The breeding period usually lasts approximately 2.6 days. Metamorphosis takes place in late July. Studies have shown that A. debilis  requires temperatures of 18.2Â° to 33.8Â° C (Degenhardt et al. 1996). 
","

","
Although A. debilis is secretive and is not usually seen, it is, overall, a common species (Bartlett and Bartlett 1999).

 Anaxyrus fowleri is an abundant toad of relatively small size, ranging from 2.00-3.75 inches SVL. While this species usually displays an immaculate venter, many specimens have been observed to have a single dark spot on the chest.  Characteristically, this species has a light-colored middorsal stripe, coupled with a brown or gray dorsal surface, though some individuals may have a green or reddish dorsal surface. In general, A. fowleri characteristically displays at least three of the following characteristics: tibia with no greatly enlarged warts, no spots on the chest or belly, the largest dark spots containing at least three warts, and a parotoid gland that borders the cranial ridge (Conant and Collins 1991). 

Similar species may be distinguished by the following features: 1) the American Toad displays no more than 2 warts in dark regions coupled with a spotted chest; 2) the Gulf Coast Toad possesses a prominent dark stripe instead of the light colored stripe observed in A. fowleri; and, 3) the posterior region of the cranial crest of the Southern Toad displays pronounced knobs. 





","
Anaxyrus fowleri is abundant along the coastal plain from Long Island to North Carolina. Moving inland from the coast, sandy regions near lakes and river valleys provide an ample habitat for the species. Following periods of long drought, A. fowleri may be observed in large numbers in regions normally not associated with the species via the onset of warm, heavy rains. The toad is not observed in Florida and southern regions of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, but may range from central New England to western Michigan. This species may also be found in northwest regions of Arkansas and eastern Louisiana (Conant and Collins 1991).




","
The vocalizations of Fowler's Toad may last from 1-4 seconds. The mating season lasts from the spring months to mid-August.  Hybridization can occur with other species, and the calls of hybrid males are difficult to identify (Conant and Collins 1991).






","

","

","

","
 The species was named after an early Massachusetts naturalist, S. P. Fowler.

This species was featured in News of the Week 26 June 2023:
Many frogs all over the world are in danger of extinction, but scientists have strategies to try and prevent mass extinctions. Conservation translocationâ€”movement of animals from one place to anotherâ€”is one such strategy. However, there is no reliable information on whether this method works in the wild for frogs. Researchers from the Memphis Zoo and Oregon State University (Poo et al. 2022) set out to find out: can frogs produced from cryopreserved sperm be used to create new and healthy populations in the wild? Using Fowler's toads (Anaxyrus fowleri), they found that tadpoles from cryopreserved sperm and post-metamorphic toadlets were smaller than their natural counterparts. They project that these early-stage differences in growth continue to become substantial differences in final life fecundity and population trends. Their study shows that more work needs to focus on cryopreservation technologies in order to make them feasible for conservation translocation.

Snout-vent length ranges from 40 to 47 mm in males and 45 to 49 mm in females. Dorsal coloration is composed of yellow blotches with green central areas, separated by thin black reticulations. The ventral surface is white. Vocal sac is greyish black in mature males. The dorsal surface is covered with low, black-tipped warts. Larger warts are found along the sides of the body. Ventrally they are covered with small, dark-tipped granules. Paratoid glands are large but inconspicuous. Warts on the paratoid are greatly reduced and tipped with black. 



","
Restricted to southern Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, north of Guaymas. This species is found most commonly in open, rolling, mesquite-grassland between 500 and 1500 ft in elevation. Its range extends into the Pacific Coastal Plain of Mexico only in the vicinity of Hermosillo, possibly as a result of increased well drilling and irrigation. 



","
Anaxyrus retiformis eggs are yellow with a band of melanin, and are about 1.15 mm in diameter. Tadpoles hatch at a later stage than most bufonids. 

Calls are made from clumps of grass usually within three feet of the water's edge. Calls are wheezy sounding and generally last 1 to 3 sec.

Atelopus chiriquiensis, the Chiriqui Harlequin Frog, is a moderately-sized frog with males reaching 28-34 mm and females 36-49 mm  
(Savage 2002). The head is angular and longer than it is wide, and lacks  a visible tympanum 
(Savage 2002).  The canthus rostralis is well-defined in this species  
(Savage 2002). The undersides of the hands and feet are wrinkled and fleshy  
(Savage 2002).  Paired metarsal and subarticular tubercles are present. Toes have extensive webbing. Adult males have paired vocal slits and a single subgular vocal sac, located internally, as well as brown nuptial pads on the thumbs  
(Savage 2002). Occasionally adults of either sex will have prominent small spicules along the anterior flank  
(Savage 2002). 

This species is highly variable in color. Males have a uniformly yellow, chartreuse, lime green or brownish red coloration  
(Leenders 2001; Savage 2002). On occasion males will also have a pattern consisting of thin black reticulations, or fine dark vermiculations  
(Savage 2002). Females are more variable in color, and are rarely similar to the males in coloration  
(Savage 2002). Many females have an orange or orange-red stripe, outlined in black, which begins at the snout and then splits into two stripes running down the sides of the back to the groin  
(Savage 2002; Leenders 2001). The stripes may also break up into long splotches  
(Savage 2002). In both sexes the ventrum is usually yellow, and generally without pattern; females sometimes have a broad black and red reticulum ventrally  
(Savage 2002). Both females and males have orangish or greenish eye color, and sometimes they may even have an eye of each color  
(Leenders 2001). The iris is gold  
(Savage 2002). 
 
This species has weakly developed and relatively inconspicuous poison glands, which are scattered over the head and dorsum  
(Leenders 2001), distinguishing it from related species. In contrast, Atelopus varius has no differentiated glandular areas, and Atelopus senex has very prominent glands  
(Savage 2002).    
  
 
A. chiriquiensis tadpoles are gastromyzophorous, with 2/3 denticle rows, and resemble those of Atelopus varius  
(Savage 2002).     

","
A. chiriquiensis occurs in the cool, humid cloudforest in the Talamanca Mountain range from Costa Rica to Panama. This species is found at elevations of 1400-2500 meters. There is some variation in habitat selection between sexes (Leenders 2001). Males prefer areas near streams and females prefer shaded forest habitat  
(Lips 1998).
","
Atelopus chiriquiensis is diurnal (Savage 2002). Males are territorial and use both calls and physical combat with other intruding male frogs to maintain their territorial boundaries  
(Savage 2002). 
 
 Breeding takes during the dry season in Panama (February) 
(Lindquist and Swihart 1997), or in the early wet season in Costa Rica (May to July) 
(Savage 2002). Advertisement calls have been described as a buzz or a pulsed call  
(Savage 2002). Chiriqui Harlequin Frogs in Parque Internacional La Amistad, Provincia de Chiriqui, Panama, were observed mating  
(Lindquist and Swihart 1997).  The habitat consisted of swift montane streams with water temperatures of 10.8 degrees C and air temperatures of 17.6 degress C, in cloud forests of 2005-2100 meters. Mating behavior occurred during both daytime and nighttime. The observed mating sex ratio was 1 female to 7 males. Females are on average 1.5x the size of males. Amplexus is axillary  
(Lindquist and Swihart 1997), and is initiated well before egg laying  
(Savage 2002). Frogs of the genus Atelopus are known for remaining in amplexus for extended periods of time, even up to several weeks  
(Leenders 2001). Males not in amplexus with a female were observed trying to dislodge other males from females, but these attempts were not successful. Amplectant mating pairs submerge themselves completely in the stream for 15-30 minutes, either to avoid attempts by other males to disrupt the mating, or possibly for females to look for egg laying sites  
(Lindquist and Swihart 1997).  
Female egg laying behavior was observed in the laboratory. Female A. chiriquiensis chose to deposit eggs in small containers containing partial amounts of unchlorinated water. Eggs were laid in a continuous process over an 8-10 hour period, producing in total two strings of ~364 unpigmented eggs. The eggs were all laid in a massive clutch, making it difficult to separate eggs without breaking the strings. The strings measured 36-44 cm in length, with an egg density of 11-13 eggs per 25 mm segment. Egg diameter was measured at 2.05 mm, and in its protective gel case the diameter was 3.63 mm. During egg laying the male performed a leg-kicking action, in which he kicked his leg 2-3 times before the female would lay 3-5 eggs onto the string. A possible reason for the leg-kicking behavior was to provide a tactile cue to the female to help her synchronize her egg release with milting. The eggs in the laboratory did not develop (Lindquist and Swihart 1997).  
When researchers returned to the original breeding site in August they found that most Chiriqui Harlequin Frogs had left the area. Only a very small number of amplectant pairs and single individuals were left, suggesting migration within the species. Migration appeared to be tied to the local rainfall patterns  
(Lindquist and Swihart 1997).   
 
These toads produce tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin (Leenders 2001). 

","

","
This species has not been observed over its normal range/distribution in recent years and is possibly extinct (Leenders 2001). In Finca Jaguar, Costa Rica, Lips  
(1998) reported that the Chiriqui Harlequin Frog was most abundant in 1991. Tadpoles and adults were seen in the area, but no juveniles. By 1994 the mark and recapture rate of Chiriqui Harlequin Frogs was extremely low, suggesting these frogs had migrated away from the area  
(Lips 1998). By 1996 there were only 5 individuals found in this area, with a female biased sex-ratio  
(Lips 1998). Potential reasons for population decline include 1)habitat destruction; 2)introduced fish; 3)environmental contamination; and 4)pathogen outbreaks 
 (Lips 1998).

Atelopus senex is a medium-sized frog, with males reaching a snout-to-vent length of 28-32 mm and females 30-43 mm (Savage 2002). This species can be easily distinguished from A. chiriquiensis and A. varius by its prominent glands on the head, dorsum and limbs  
(Savage 2002).  
 
 The head is angular, and longer than it is wide  
(Savage 2002). It has a narrow, rounded snout with a depression between the canthi  
(Taylor 1952). The snout projects beyond the lips  
(Taylor 1952). Nostrils are closer to the tip of the nose than to the eyes  
(Taylor 1952). The lips are lighter in color and have a distinct medial notch  
(Taylor 1952). From the eye there is a bony temporal ridge and a distinct post-orbital ridge coming off of it  
(Taylor 1952). There are no visible tympana  
(Savage 2002). On the shoulders the suprascapulae form a prominent ridge  
(Taylor 1952). The body is slender, with long arms and legs  
(Savage 2002). More than half of the forearm extends past the tip of the snout  
(Taylor 1952). The fingers are thickened at the base and have terminal pads  
(Taylor 1952). Thumbs are webbed basally and have brown nuptial pads in the male  
(Savage 2002). The toes are fully webbed and have small terminal pads  
(Taylor 1952). The skin has multiple tubercles in the groin region  
(Taylor 1952).  Tubercles are also scattered on the sides of the neck and body as well as on the front surface of the upper arm  
(Taylor 1952). There are tiny pustules on the dorsum in many individuals, and occasionally spicules on the anterior flanks in larger adults  
(Savage 2002).  
Males may be bluish gray, blue-green, black, or occasionally greenish, and tend to have a uniform ground color  
 
(Savage 2002). In males, the parotoid and limb glands are pink to cream-colored  
(Savage 2002).  Females have similar ground coloration but may be patterned.  The patterning on females consists of contrasting dark and light areas, with the light areas being cream, lemon, or lime-colored  
 
(Savage 2002). For both sexes, the venter is gray, sometimes with a yellow to orange tinge, and may or may not have black markings  
(Savage 2002).
","
A. senex is known from only three localities in Costa Rica, one in the VolcÃ¡n Barva region and two on the extreme northern slopes of the Cordillera de Talamanca. It is found associated with streams in high premontane rainforest and lower montane wet forest and rainforest, from 1,280 - 2,040 m in elevation (Savage, 2002)[3049].
","
A. senex is a diurnal, stream-breeding frog (Savage, 2002)[3049]. The breeding period is from July to August  
(Savage 2002). This species of frog has been observed to walk more frequently than hop  
(Taylor 1952).
","

","
This species suffered a severe decline in 1987-1988, from which it has not recovered. It is also thought to be extinct in the VolcÃ¡n Barva region (Savage, 2002)[3049].
","

","
Coloration varies among the three known populations. Frogs from the VolcÃ¡n Barva region are mostly uniformly colored, while those from the Macizo de Cedral are  sexually dimorphic in coloration, and those from the Rio ReventazÃ³n drainage area show variability (Savage, 2002)[3049].

Dorsal coloration is mottled light and dark, with ground coloration ranging
from lime-green to yellow-orange and surface markings in black (from dots to
uniform coloring).  The ventral surface ranges from yellow-green to orange with
the same type of black surface markings.  The throat and venter can appear bright
scarlet, and the groin can appear blue-green or green. The snout is short,
and in profile acute or rounded.  The pupil is horizontally elliptical, there is no
tympanum, and there are no distinct glandular ridges.  Paired elongate vocal
slits run parallel and lateral to the tongue; males have an internal
vocal sac.  Males have webbing between the first and second finger, and the
first finger also bears a nuptial pad.  Toes are webbed except for IV, and
there is no tarsal fold (all descriptions from Savage 1972).  Snout-vent
length of adult males ranges from 25 to 41 mm, and females are 33 to 60 mm in
length (Savage 1972; Crump 1988).  Both bufadienolide and
tetrodotoxin skin toxins are present in wild A. varius
(Daly et al. 1997). 




","
A. varius is found from western Panama to the Canal Zone, through
Central Talamanca and Chiriqui, and on both the Atlantic and Pacific slopes
of the Cordilleras de Tilaran in Costa Rica (Savage 1972).  It has been
found at elevations ranging from 16 to 2000 meters, in life zones
Holdridge (1967) characterizes as Tropical Lowland, Premontane, and Lower
Montane.  This habitat includes both dry and wet forest following small stream
courses, where the seasonal weather pattern is divided into a wet (late May to
mid-November) and dry season  (Savage 1972; Crump 1988).




","
The Harlequin Frog is diurnal. It is usually found sitting on rocks and logs near a stream or in rock crevices during the day, and within crevices or
low vegetation at night (Crump and Pounds 1985).  It is a poor swimmer
that rarely enters streams, and appears to depend on wet
surfaces in the splash zone for moisture (Pounds and Crump 1994).  It feeds on small
arthropods (generally no larger than 7 mm in size) which are more abundant
during the dry season (Crump 1988).  It is slow-moving, sedentary, and
less wary than other local frogs; these characteristics appear to be adaptive
behaviors related to aposematism (Crump and Pounds 1985).  Some
individuals are long-lived and have been recaptured over 3 consecutive years
(Crump and Pounds 1985).  Over the year, Harlequin Frogs tend to aggregate in waterfall splash zones with the progression of 
the dry season (Pounds and Crump 1987; Crump and Pounds 1989).  The only known
predator or parasite is the sarcophagid fly, Notochaeta bufonivora, (Crump and Pounds 1985). The fly larviposits on the posterior surface of the frog's thigh,
and the larvae subsequently burrow and feed within it, killing the frog
within a matter of days (Pounds and Crump 1987). Males begin
calling and defending territories at the onset of the wet season, and pairing
begins 2 to 5 months later, from mid-August through early December
(Pounds and Crump 1987; Crump 1988).  The sex ratio is male-biased, and males often enter into amplexus early and remain with the
female for as long as 32 days (Crump 1988).  Females deposit eggs in the
water from the end of the wet season to the early dry
season, October to December (Pounds and Crump 1987). 
Crump (1988) has documented the aggressive behavior of A. varius, which occurs within and between the sexes and is characterized
by forelimb and foot wagging, chasing, pouncing, and squashing.  Male-male antagonism is
generally longer than female-female aggression and involves chirp-like
advertisement calls and wrestling behavior.  Male aggression is
heightened both during the breeding season and in high density situations
(Crump 1988).  Female-female aggression lacks wrestling and calling,
is generally less intense and less frequent, and seems to be related to the
defense of foraging and/or shelter sites (Crump 1988).  Intersexual
aggression is almost always female to male; females will chase, pounce on, and squash males who have invaded their territory, and they will
attack males whom they have dislodged from amplexus. The only hostile
behavior of males towards females is holding the amplectant position despite a
female's efforts to disengage. In a series of invasion
experiments, Crump (1988) demonstrated that territorial residents have
the advantage in combat and higher success despite size differences. 




","

","
Declines of A. variushave been documented in the Cordillera de Tilaran,
near Monteverde, Costa Rica.  Census studies conducted
between 1982 and 1983 reported an average of 751 adults along a 200 m transect
(Crump and Pounds 1985), a number which appeared stable up to the late
1980's. Surveys conducted between 1990 and 1992, however,
did not detect a single frog (Pounds and Crump 1994).  It remains absent
from the Monteverde area.Several causal explanations for this disappearance have been
proposed, most involving climatic factors in a direct or synergistic manner.
Pounds and Crump (1994) examined weather data and noted the correlation
between the adults' disappearance and the 1982-1983 and the 1986-1987
El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation events.  This led them to hypothesize several
climate-based causes of the decline: moisture stress, temperature stress,
a climate-linked epidemic, and a climate-linked contaminant pulse.
Recent studies have linked this and other declines to more subtle but cumulative
weather changes caused by global warming.  Pounds et al. (1999) conducted
a careful analysis of precipitation, air temperature, sea surface temperature,
and stream flow patterns as they related to tropical anuran, avian, and anoline
lizard communities. They concluded that declines like that of the Harlequin Frog were not simply an
effect of the El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation, but rather of a long-term warming trend
which crossed a threshold in late 1980's and precipitated a broad tropical anuran
decline. This decline was accompanied by a decline in anoline lizard communities and significant restructuring of tropical avian communities.Of the
proposed causes, the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis
(Pounds and Crump 1994) appears particularly important in the decline of
A. varius in light of the discovery of the parasitic fly N. bufonivora in 1982 (Crump and Pounds 1985; Pounds and Crump 1987).  
The fly seems to cause density-dependent mortality
(Crump and Pounds 1985), as clumping of frogs during the dry season of
1982 (an El NiÃ±o year) was correlated with increased fly parasitism. Parasitism is particularly intense near waterfall spray zones,
where Harlequin Frogs aggregate when extreme dry conditions threaten their water
balance (Pounds and Crump 1987).An additional epidemic and
density-dependent threat to A. varius has appeared in the form of a
novel pathogen.  In 1997, Berger et al (1998) documented three deceased
A. varius specimens from Fortuna, Panama which had been killed by a
chytridiomycete fungus.  This fungal pathogen invades keratinized body surfaces and kills postmetamorphic anurans
within several weeks.  Tests show that the chytrid fungus can be spread by skin scrapings from
other individuals, and may impair cutaneous respiration and osmoregulation when
it attacks the hypervascularized pelvic patch (Berger et al 1998).  It has
been documented as fatal in adults from 18 other species, both in South America
and Australia, and has been implicated as a widespread cause of anuran decline
(Berger et al 1998).

Bufo bankorensis is the largest species of frog found on Taiwan, with adult males ranging from 60-110 mm and females from 36.5-104 mm in snout-vent length.  Head length is about the same as head width.  Tympana are small, about 1/3 the size of the eyes, and partly covered by skin. Parotoid glands are present and shaped like kidney beans. The dorsal surfaces and limbs are warty.   Hind limbs are very short.  Webbing is present on four of five toes (Fei 1999).  

Dorsal coloration varies and may be reddish, yellowish, greenish or dark brown.  Patterning also varies, with some individuals having a dorsolateral black stripes, running beneath each parotoid gland. Black or orange-reddish dots may or may not be present. These frogs are reportedly also capable of metachrosis, or changing color (ymsnp.gov.tw).

Tadpoles are about 36 mm in total length, with the heads about 13.3 mm.  Bodies and tails are blackish brown, with a gray tail tip (Fei 1999).  




","
Bufo bankorensis is endemic to Taiwan, and widely distributed over the island (Fei 1999). It is generally found in mountainous or hilly areas but occurs at elevations ranging from sea level to 2,700 meters (IUCN 2006). Habitat includes broadleaf forest, mixed forests, orchards, and cultivated fields (IUCN 2006);  this species has also been reported to occur at the edges of farms, gardens, creeks, and roads, in dirt holes, and under rocks (Fei 1999).
","
Bufo bankorensis is nocturnal (Fei 1999).  Breeding season differs depending on the altitude (and temperature) at which a population resides (Huang et al. 2005).  Two populations have been described: the high-elevation, temperate population breeds throughout the year, while the lower-elevation, subtropical population has a more limited breeding season, extending from September to February (Huang et al. 2005). They breed in streams and more permanent pools (IUCN 2006).  Eggs are black and pearl-like and are laid in long strands (ymsnp.gov.tw). Tadpoles hatch in about five days, are dark black in color and gather together to form large groups (ymsnp.gov.tw). Tadpoles feed on humus and algae (ymsnp.gov.tw).  

Adult B. bankorensis consume mainly ants (53%), with coleopterans (16%) and termites (9 %) also providing significant portions of the diet (Hou, unpublished data, cited in Huang et al. 2007).
","

","
Bufo bankorensis are very common in Taiwan and are classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2006).
","
The skin and skin secretions of Bufo bankorensis are sometimes used for traditional medicinal purposes in Taiwan. The white fluid extracts from the parotoid glands are made into a dry paste and then eaten. The paste is believed to have antidote-like and diuretic purposes (e-info.org.tw).

A medium to large toad. Parotoids behind the eyes are prominent. Pupil of the eye is horizontal. Tympanic membrane not visible. No male resonator. No tarsal fold. 2nd and 3rd toes with paired subarticular tubercles. Dorsal skin usually with rounded tubercles, sometimes with sharp top. Dorsal surface white-grayish, gray, brown or olive-brown with more or less developed darker spots. These spots are sometimes absent, sometimes fused into irregular longitudinal bands. Background coloration changes during the breeding season, becoming uniform. Belly light-gray or yellowish-gray with dark spots. 

Male differs from female in having nuptial pads on 1st finger (during the breeding season on 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd fingers), smaller body size and in some body proportions. In the Carpathian Mountains, sexual differences in toad breeding coloration have been described: males have uniform, light-greenish-brownish dorsal coloration, whereas females are more brown with dark-brown spots which sometime fuse into irregular longitudinal bands most distinct on the flanks.











","
The species is widespread in Europe. 
Northern margin of its range extends from Norway and Sweden (ca. 65-67oN) to Northern Finland (Saariselka, Muanio and Kittila at 68Â° N to Northern Russia: from the northern coast of the White Sea in Murmansk Province (Kandalaksha Nature Reserve: 66Â° 35'N, 33Â° 13'E) and covers the whole of Karelia. It occurs through Arkhangelsk Province (from the environs of Arkhangelsk City: 
64Â° 36'N, 40Â° 32'E to Pinezhskii Nature Reserve), then approximately along 
the line Komi Republics - through Urals to Tyumen Province (Yamal-Nenets
 Autonomous County) - Krasnoyarsk Region (middle flow of Enisei River). Then 
it turns south-south-eastwards to the Chuna River in Krasnoyarsk Region and 
Irkutsk Province in the East Siberia. The easternmost known locality is
 Kunerma Settlement in Kazachinsko-Lensk District of Irkutsk Province
 (56Â° N, 108Â° 30'E). Thus, the major part of the northern margin of the 
range of  B. bufo  in Asia approximately corresponds to the latitude 63-64Â° N. 
Further studies of the species distribution at its northern limit, and 
especially in its eastern part, are necessary. Southern margin of the range 
in Europe corresponds approximately to the southern limits of the latter. It 
is absent, however, from many European islands (Balears, Corsica, Sardinia,
 Malta, Crete etc.). 

On the continental part, the southern margin runs by the right bank of Dnieper River in Ukraine approximately along the line Kherson City (48Â° 38'N, 32Â° 37'E) - area of Zaporozhie City - Dnepropetrovsk Province - Donetsk Province - Kharkov Province - Lugansk Province. Then the margin runs in Russia in the southwest of Byelgorod Province - Voronezh Province - Tambov City (52Â° 43'N, 41Â° 26'E) - south-east of Penza Province - Ulyanovsk Province - north of Saratov Province. Then the margin runs to northwestern Kazakhstan: north of Uralsk Province. The toad probably exists on the rivers Uil and Temir southwards to 49Â° N. Then the margin turns northeastwards in Russia approximately along the line Orenburg Province - Chelyabinsk Province - Kurgan Province - south of Tyumen 
Province in the West Siberia - east of Omsk Province. Then the margin turns to the south-south-east at a level of about 55Â° E to the Northeastern Kazakhstan. Then the margin runs to the south-east 
and south along the valley of the Irtysh River to Semipalatinsk  Province and the East Kazakhstan Province and then, probably, to China.

Bufo bufo from the Anatolian Turkey area, Syrian Arab Republic, and Lebanon, is referred to the subspecies verrucosisimus (formerly a separate species) by Recuero et al 2012. The subspecies Bufo bufo verrucosisimus or Caucasian Toad differs by its larger size (ranging from 70-190 mm snout-vent lenght), body proportions, tongue shape, skin texture and coloration and more pronounced sexual dimorphism in body size. In the Caucasian toad, males do not have a resonator, or a tarsal fold. In addition, the Caucasian toad has 2nd and 3rd toes with paired subarticular tubercles. The dorsal skin contains large rounded tubercles, and the ventral skin has small tubercles. The dorsal surface is gray or light-brown, with dark spots. Longitudinal stripes, more or less developed, are present on parotoids. The belly is gray or yellowish. The male differs from female by a considerably smaller body size and other characters similar to those involved in the sexual dimorphism of B. bufo. However, there is no sexual dimorphism in coloration. (Tarkhnishvili and Gokhelashvili 1999).

The Common Toad is associated mainly with the forest zone (in conifer,
 mixed and deciduous forests), where it prefers conifer forests with 
marshes. It lives in groves, bushlands, parks and gardens, generally 
in fairly wet sites with dense vegetation. Large open areas are avoided
 but in forested landscapes the toad readily inhabits bushlands, meadows, 
fields, glades, gardens, vineyards etc. In the south of the range, the toad 
lives in insular forests in the zone of forest steppe and in wet and dense
 riparian vegetation. Spawning takes place in lakes, ponds, ditches, large 
puddles and streams with relatively clear water, quite variable in area and 
depth.











","
In most habitats, Bufo bufo is not very abundant, although sometimes up to 70 specimens are found per 100 m of pond shore or, on land, to 200 individuals per hectare.

As other toads,  B. bufo is active mainly in twilight. The activity in light time, common for the toads of the  Bufo viridis  group, is rare in the Common Toad. The toads hibernate singly or in groups from September - beginning of November to March - June, depending on the altitude and latitude. Hibernation occurs on land and occasionally in streams and springs. Usually, the hibernation is finished in April - May. Reproduction occurs from March - June (usually late April - May). Amplexus is pectoral. A few males often clasp one female, and in many instances several males try to clasp the same female, and large ""balls"" consisting of numerous toads may be observed. The smallest males are forced out by larger individuals. Therefore, assortative (by body size) mating takes place. Embryonic and larval development takes usually 1.5-2.5 months.

Common Toad forages exclusively on land, mainly on crawling invertebrates. As in other species of toads, consumption of ants is very typical. This results from the sit-and-wait foraging tactics in this species. Numerous predators, parasites and morphological anomalies are known in this toad species. However, their real impact in its population dynamics remains unknown. If faced by a potential predator, the adult toad lifts its body on straight legs and butts its head toward the danger.











","

","
Destruction of forests and meadows, as well as artificial drying of wetlands compose the most serious threats for populations of  B. bufo . These factors are responsible for the extinction of some populations. On a global scale, deforestation of the European south may have resulted in a retreat of the species' range northwards. Pollution of the environment by mineral fertilizers and industrial wastes, recreation, urbanization, mortality on roads, meaningless killing by people etc. result in the gradual decline of populations of  B. bufo  in settlements and cities. Natural factors may also influence the abundance and distribution of this species. For example, in Moscow Province in 1990s its abundance gradually increases, and the Common toad appears in places where it was absent in the past.
The UK has designated the species as a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) priority species in response to declines in some areas of central and lowland England, and on the Channel Island of Jersey (John W. Wilkinson & John Buckley, FrogLog 2012).










","
Main threats related to human activities were indicated above. Although a few populations of the Common Toad are able to survive even in cities, it has moderate possibilities for synanthropization: the toad is practically extinct from many large cities where many other amphibians are in relatively safe condition.

 B. bufo  have a tendency to breed in the same location they were born, even if other breeding areas are available nearby. This increases their susceptibility to landscape development by humans (John W. Wilkinson & John Buckley, FrogLog 2012).

How will increasing temperatures from the climate crisis impact amphibian aging and mortality? Despite its relevance to conservation, little data exists on the relationship between temperature and senescence in free-living animals. Cayuela et al. (2021) studied pairs of frogs from two families divided by 100 million years of evolutionary history to answer this: Rana luteiventris and R. temporaria (Ranidae) and Anaxyrus boreas and Bufo bufo (Bufonidae). The North American toads (Bufonidae) represented sampling along a climatic gradient, whereas the ranid frogs represented sampling from climatically contrasted sites. They found that actuarial senescence ratesâ€” i.e., the rate at which mortality increases with ageâ€” increased with the mean annual temperature experienced in all species. In all species but Anaxyrus boreas, increasing temperatures corresponded to decreasing lifespans. These relationships are presumably attributed to amphibians' increasing pace of life with increasing temperatures; they are active for longer periods, have a higher metabolism, lower mitochondrial efficiency, and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly. The impacts of increasing temperature on these frogs might be exacerbated by increasing evaporative water loss and influenced by genes involved in adapting amphibians to warmer conditions. In the ranids studied, the authors found increasing temperatures flipped sex differences in senescence rate in R. luteiventris but not R. temporaria. These results paint a grim picture for amphibians as global temperatures increase. Amphibian aging is expected to accelerate, with potential skewing sex ratios in some species.

No one likes mosquitos, or the diseases they transmit, but there is a positive link between their abundance and human-caused landscape alterations. Conversely, while amphibian density has been shown to have a negative relationship on mosquitos density, amphibians also are negatively impacted by human modifications to their habitat. Perrin et al. (2023) examined the interaction of these relationships with a survey of 77 anthropized ponds in western Switzerland. While their methods were indirect, their structural equation models and path analyses point to ponds with amphibians having reduced abundance and diversity of mosquitoes, likely through limiting competition and predation by amphibians. Their analysis also found that ponds were more likely to have amphibians if they were deeper and older, as mosquitos often colonize new ponds immediately while it takes a few years for their predators to do so. The authors argue that removing wetlands to reduce mosquito populations is counterproductive as it impacts mosquito predators more than mosquitos, and they encourage the development of more measures to protect amphibians.

This toad ranges in snout-vent length from 56-102 mm.  It is very similar to  
the Common Toad (Bufo bufo), but differs from it mainly by 
 having spines on the dorsal skin tubercles and a black band which extends 
 from the outer surface of the parotoid onto the body flank. Tympanic membrane  
either very small or covered with skin. Dorsal skin tubercles large. Dorsal 
 coloration dark-gray, olive-gray or olive-brownish, with three wide 
 longitudinal bands. Wide dark band extends from the inner surface of the  
parotoid onto the body flank. This band is interrupted posteriorly into large 
 spots. Belly grayish or yellowish, without pattern or with small spots  
posteriorly. The sexual differences are the same as in the Common Toad.  
Females are larger than males. The hindlegs seem to be relatively longer 
 in males, whereas females have a wider head. 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Bufo gargarizans lives in China (provinces of Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi,  
Zhajiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Inner 
 Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Liaonin, Jilin and  
Heilongjiang). 

Previous populations in Korea, Japan, the Russian Far East (northwards to the Amur  
River valley, as well as some islands, including Sakhalin) and East Siberia (Transbaikalia) have been distinguishable into other closely related species (see Othman et al 2022).
","
The population density of the toad reaches in some places to dense levels (3600 individuals 
 per square kilometer). Population density varies considerably between years and habitats.  
In the northeastern part of the range hibernation occurs from September - 
 October to April - May, and reproduction from April - May, or in some habitats to late  
June. Hibernation occurs on land and also occurs in rivers and lakes at depths of  
more than one meter.  

Reproduction occurs in lakes, ponds, swamps, puddles, old riverbeds, 
 ditches and rivulets with stagnant or semi-flowing water. Males enter breeding areas 
 before females. Amplexus is pectoral.  

The clutch in the form of two strings of eggs, 1.5-2.3 m in length, containing 1200-7400  
eggs. Metamorphosis occurs in summer. Mass mortality of B. gargarizans 
 larvae occurs in pools with high tadpole density of the brown frog  Rana dybowskii. 

Sexual maturity of this toad is probably attained during the 3rd-4th year of life; the majority of adults are 5-6 years old. 

Adult B. gargarizans consume insects, especially Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Other invertebrates such as Mollusca, Myriapoda and Arachnoidea are eaten in smaller quantities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
The Asiatic Toad is a widespread species and is not declining. 
 
 Some peripheral populations, especially at the northern margin of the range (North China, probably Transbaikalia), are small and isolated, and they may be vulnerable to the alteration of habitats.
 
 
 

","
The influence of anthropogenic factors on B. gargarizans is  
insufficiently known. The species possesses a good potential for  
synanthropization, especially in central, optimal parts of its range.  
It often occurs in settlements and cities which results, however, in its  
mortality on roads.

Capensibufo rosei is a relatively small species, with males about 28 mm and females about 39 mm (Minter et al. 2004). The head is narrow and the snout is rounded with a slight truncated appearance (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The eye pupil is horizontally elliptical, and an umbraculum can be seen on the upper edge (Minter et al. 2004, du Preez and Carruthers 2009). Capensibufo rosei lacks a tympanum and middle ear elements. The parotid gland is pear-shaped with the widest part being the anterior section. The elongated body of this toad is dorsally smooth with ridges and warts scattered throughout the back and sides. Ventrally, the posterior region has heavily granulated skin (Minter et al. 2004). This toad lacks dorsolateral, supratympanic, and tarsal folds (Channing 2001). The hind-limbs are short, better adapted for walking and running than for jumping (Minter et al. 2004). The finger and toe tips are slender and there is no webbing in between digits (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). There is no evidence of vocal sacs and in fact C. rosei is the only species known in South Africa that does not call (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). Breeding males have nuptial pads on their first and second fingers (du Preez and Carruthers 2009).  The cloaca swells in males during breeding season (Minter et al. 2004).

It has been noted that the tadpoles of C. rosei have been able to grow up to a total length of 21 mm in a slender conformation (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The upper and lower tail fins are set parallel to each other and meet relatively parallel to the body of the tadpole (Channing 2001). The tail tip is blunt and rounded. The eyes are dorsolaterally located and the nostrils are small and lie closer to the eyes than the snout (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The nostrils are spaced widely and approximately equivalent in distance as the eyes are from each other (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The spiracle is located on the sinistral side of the body while the vent is located medially where the body and tail meet (Channing 2001). The mouth is located ventrally with a single row of papillae located at the mouth corners. For the labial tooth row formula, one source noted that it was 2(2)/3; however, an early source cited that it was 1(1)/3(1) (Channing 2001; du Preez and Carruthers 2009). 

According to Atlas and Red Data Book of the Frogs of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, C. rosei â€œcannot be confused with any other toad in its distribution rangeâ€ (Minter et al. 2004) presumably because of its lack of a tympanum. Differentiating between C. rosei and C. tradouwi, is not difficult. Firstly, their ranges do not overlap. Morphologically and behaviorally, in contrast to C. rosei, C. tradouwi has a tympanum and an advertisement call, both of which the former lacks. Capensibufo rosei also â€œlays eggs in strings of jelly,â€ rather than as single eggs as C. tradouwi does (Minter et al. 2004). Also in contrast to C. rosei, C. tradouwi the anterior third of the parotid is not the widest part and the latter has a vertebral strip, white flecks on the belly that may fuse to form short lines, and a smaller parotid to snout-urostyle length ratio.  From C. deceptus, C. rosei can be differentiated by the latter lacking a tympanum, a rounded umbraculum (vs. angular), and typically lacking a vertebral strip. From C. magistratus, C. rosei can be differentiated by the latter having incomplete dark rings without a thin outer white ring around their dorsal spots, a rounded umbraculum, having the widest part of the parotoid being the anterior third, typically lacking a vertebral strip, and having a solid colored or lightly speckled belly. From C. selenophos, the focal species can be differentiated by having incomplete dark rings without white lines around their dorsal spots, having the widest part of the parotid being the anterior third, typically not having a vertebral band, and having a solid or lightly speckled belly instead of white spots on a darker background (Channing et al. 2017).  

Coloration of adult amphibians, as described in live specimens, ranges from grey to brown on the upper body surface. The underside is primarily white, although grey shading and dark markings may be present. The limb coloration is continuous with body coloration. The upper body has dark spots and blotches (Minter et al. 2004). A light vertebral stripe and a pair of dorsolateral bands are often present (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The inverted, pear-shaped parotoid glands are usually red or orange, and other markings of this color may be found elsewhere on the upper body (Minter et al. 2004). There is also a pale interorbital bar (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). There is no sexual dimorphism in coloration and patterning. As for metachrosis, during the breeding season a bright pink oval patch appears below the vent in both sexes (Minter et al. 2004). The purpose of this patch is unknown, though some believe it may be involved in chemical attraction (Channing 2001). The iris is bronze in color.

Live specimens of tadpoles are dark in color, with the inner part of the tail being darker than the outermost part of the tail (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The eggs are pigmented (Minter et al. 2004).

The literature is primarily in agreement with each other regarding coloration. However, Channingâ€™s Amphibians of Central and Southern Africa says that the back is black or dark brown while all other sources say coloration ranges a shade lighter, from grey to brown (Channing 2001). This could be a matter of Channing not being explicit about if the coloration is in life or in preservative. Additionally, as noted above, there was dissent over the labial row tooth formula for tadpoles:  Channingâ€™s early book noting a 1(1)/3(1) formula while a more recent field guide by du Preez and Carruthers noting a 2(2)/3 formula (Channing 2001; du Preez and Carruthers 2009). Other features include sexual dimorphism of vent positions, male vents opens downwards while female vents open upwards (Minter et al. 2004).
","
While previously thought to be more widespread, genetic analysis confirms that the species is only endemic to the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. Specifically, it is only known from Table Mountain National Park at the Silvermine and Cape of Good Hope sections. The current range extends from Table Mountain to the Cape of Good Hope, however, it has not been seen on Table Mountain itself since 1983 (Channing et al. 2017).

The species is found on mountaintops and plateaus.  This particular species has been noted to seek refuge among the native flora of the peninsula (Channing 2001). The species associates with small, temporary pools of water - although bodies of water are present year-round - primarily during the breeding season. These pools are relatively shallow (2 - 6 cm in depth) and consist of a dark, rocky foundation with a layer of peat and moss on top (Channing 2001; Minter et al. 2004). 


","
Roseâ€™s Mountain Toadlet is presumably a nocturnal species (IUCN Red List 2010). Capensibufo rosei is largely a terrestrial species and can typically be found on flat mountain tops; however, it has also been seen on the low-lying plateaus of the southern peninsula (Minter et al. 2004). 

Developed C. rosei do not call. They lack a tympanum and middle-ear elements that normally play a role in hearing; it is unknown how the females of this species are attracted by the males (Channing 2001). It is also unknown whether or not the frogs (males or females) engage in territorial behaviors. Information on what type of amplexus the males use when breeding has not been observed (Minter et al. 2004). 

Breeding takes place in late winter to early spring, which is August to September in the Southern Hemisphere (Channing 2001) in large aggregations (Channing et al. 2017). Female  C. rosei are oviparous and lay their eggs in small, shallow ponds formed during the rainy winter (Minter et al. 2004). Breeding pools range in size from 20 x 20 x 2 cm to 250 x 150 x 6 cm. The vegetation around the breeding pools primarily consists of restios, which are rush-like plants endemic to South. The species has not been recorded laying eggs in any moving water (Minter et al. 2004). The eggs, usually less than 100, are laid in single â€œstringsâ€ where each dark, beady egg (~1.6 mm in diameter) is connected to one another by a jelly-like tube (Channing 2001). An interesting behavior of C. rosei is that they lay very large egg masses, up to a thousand eggs in a single pool, and when they are disturbed or threatened the adults have been known to hide under the egg mass (Minter et al. 2004).

The tadpoles hatch from the eggs, which can take up to a total of 12 days due to the fact that they must exit the capsule that encases the eggs in a string-like manner (Minter et al. 2004). Parental care has not been observed in this species and it can be presumed that the adults do not perform parental behaviors (Minter et al. 2004). 

The larvae prefer small, shallow ponds with dark substrate, which match their coloration and therefore would aid their ability to camouflage. It takes about 51 days before tadpoles of this species metamorphose (Channing 2001). 

The diet of adult C. rosei is unknown but tadpoles of this species have been seen eating egg capsules as well as feeding on toad carcases (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). Anti-predator behavior has not been observed due to a lack of information on predators and prey of C. rosei (Minter et al. 2004). 

It has not been determined whether or not the species produces toxins but it has been noted that their parotid glands (as well as other elevations on their skin) are colored red/orange, which is usually an indicator of aposematism (Minter et al. 2004).

","

","
As of 2017 the conservation status of C. rosei has been listed as â€œVulnerableâ€ by the IUCN due to the fact that their habitat is restricted and subject to increased disturbance (du Preez and Carruthers 2009). The population of C. rosei is currently declining due to factors such as deforestation, habitat loss from anthropogenic dams, agricultural practices from the former pine industry, increased susceptibility to disease, increased exposure to UV radiation, and invasive plant species (IUCN 2010; Tarrant et al. 2013; Minter et al. 2004). The species occurs within some nationally protected areas of South Africa, such as the Silvermine Nature Reserve and Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve (Minter et al. 2004)

In 2011, a national exercise prioritized the species for conservation work (Cressey et al. 2015). But in a 2015 survey, the species was not found in at least four known breeding sites described in the 1980s. This suggests local extinction, although it is possible individuals were present but unable to be found (Cressey et al. 2015). It is believed that a review on C. rosei by the IUCN would result in a relisting from vulnerable to endangered, which would highlight the need for more conservation action (Cressy et al. 2015).  During field surveys it was noticed that the number of tadpoles were lower at Cape Point. This could be because of natural fluctuations in population size, but it raises concerns about the long-term survival of the population. The small population could suffer even more because of the genetic drift caused by a small breeding pool (Cressey et al. 2015). Because of all this, a research team studying the species suggests that because of their isolation from other populations, both Cape Peninsula populations should be managed as separate units. They also believe that conservation efforts need to focus on the growth and protection of each population and their environments. Ideally, the different populations would be connected using historically viable habitats because it would increase genetic diversity (Cressey et al. 2015).

Between 2010 and 2017, C. rosei was confirmed to be a species complex including at least four distinct clades. The IUCN Red List status was determined based on the full complex and not on the individual species. Thus it is likely that the species is in more dire conditions. As of 2017, only two known breeding populations were known with several other populations having disappeared by unknown causes (Tolley et al. 2010, Channing et al. 2017).

Capensibufo rosei was initially placed in the genus Bufo until Grandison (1980) erected the genus Capensibufo. Until 2017, the genus only had two species, C. rosei and C. tradouwi, which could be differentiated by range and the lack of a tympanum in the former (Channing et al. 2017).

Prior to 2010, only two species of Capensibufo were recognized. However based on Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum Parsimony analysis of ND2 and 16S mitochondrial DNA, it was acknowledged that C. tradouwi had two distinct lineages and C. rosei had at least four distinct lineages (Tolley et al. 2010). In 2017, three new species in the C. rosei complex were described and named, C. deceptus, C. magistratus, and C. selenophos (Channing et al. 2017). From the two studies, it appears that C. rosei is equally related to the clade formed by the population from du Toitsberg (C. deceptus) and to the clade formed by populations from Klein River Mountain (C. selenophos), Akkedisberg, Landdroskop (C. magistratus), Jonaskop, and Hawekwas.

The species C. rosei was named after Walter Rose, a Cape naturalist and herpetologist who contributed quite a bit to the knowledge of frog natural history (du Preez and Carruthers 2009; Channing et al. 2017).

This species was highlighted in News of the Week:
January 8, 2018: Biodiversity survey work is a critical step to assess and monitor the state of amphibians in any given area, even protected ones. A herpetology survey conducted by Shrestha and Shah (2017) in Manaslu Conservation Area in western Nepal along the China border illustrates this in a multi-pronged strategy. Their survey included traditional methods such as literature review, visual encounter surveys, patch sampling and opportunistic observations combined with less commonly used ethnographic questionnaire. Of the 21 species documented by the literature, they found 5 species including a new record for the area. Of the 8 species of documented amphibians, only Duttaphrynus himalayanus was encountered in the field; three frog species were noted in interviews as popular food items. The authors note this local â€˜delicacyâ€™ could have significant impact on biodiversity and show how taking into account human use is an important part of survey work. (Written by Michelle Koo)

The Asian Common Toad is a widespread species occurring throughout South-East Asia and southern China, south to East Java and Bali and as far west as India and Pakistan.

Until recently this species was reported as the common toad of Indo-Pakistan subcontinent (GÃ¼nther, 1864; Murray, 1884; Boulenger, 1890; Annandale and Rao, 1918). However, in Pakistan, this toad is confined to the rugged mountains of District Hazara, Northwestern Frontier Province, Alpine Punjab and Azad Kashmir (Mertens, 1969a; Khan, 1972a).

It is a human commensal species often occurring in disturbed habitat or man-made habitat. 


","
Life history: A rare toad in Pakistan mostly confined to the low northern hilly ranges and Azad Kashmir. Nocturnal, appears soon after sunset; during day hides under stones, logs, piles of vegetation, holes and crevices among stones and in ground. Once a suitable place is selected, it is permanently shared with several toads. 

     The toad is lethargic timid animal. It moves about with deliberate hops from place to place in search of insects on which it feeds. In tropical southeast Asia it is most common amphibian, coming out after sunset in large numbers and  frequents mostly the human habitations, where it congregate under street lamps to feed on photophilic insects (Church, 1960).

     In temperate environs of western Himalayas, the breeding is initiated by the monsoon rains, from July to August. Males, gather in  shallow  side-pools along  torrents and ponds. The call in  low melodious ""curr, curr, curr"" repeated several times ending in a whistling note. The calling males become quite aggressive, tugging and jumping over each other, males for exceed female in numbers. It  breeds in every available space containing some water from first showers of monsoon rains in the southern India (McCann, 1938). Males are much smaller than females.  However, in tropical southeast Asia, the toad is known to breed throughout the year (Church, 1960). 

     Calling males occasionally jump over each other and try to secure a nuptial hold on each other; however, kicks and zestful wriggling dislodge them from each other and soon they resume calling. The females lurch round, as soon one comes close, a male jumps over it and quickly tightens it nuptial clasp, the other suitors are shaken off as the nuptial pair moves to a quitter place away from the site.

     The eggs are laid in a double jelly string, generally in deep quieter water, where the egg-string is entangled in the vegetation or female moves round the submerged vegetation to wound the egg string round it. An egg is enclosed in a double gelatinous capsule (Khan, 1982b).

 Tadpole: The tadpoles are uniform dark, inhabits side pools along hilly torrents, schools of them swarm along the marginal waters of ponds and puddles feeding on any type of algal material. The body is typically bufonid, globular with weak tail, dorsal fin is broad while ventral is narrow. The oral disc is typically bufonid, with 2(2)/3 labial  tooth row formula, the oral papillae are lateral. The beak is finely serrated and sharp (Khan, 1991a). 

 Total length of tadpole 26-27 mm, tail  19-20 mm.


The swarms of recently metamorphosed toadlets from synchronized pairings leave water, many fall pray to several kind of predators, while several are crushed under feet and passing traffic.  

Karyotype number recorded for this species is 22 (Nataranjan, 1953).

Exterminates crop pests and other insects.

In Pakistan, this toad is a highland species and does not extend in the Indus Valley.
 
Recent geographic, genetic and ecological analysis show that Duttaphrynus melanostictus is comprised of three distinct lineages: Asian mainland, coastal Myanmar, and Sundaic islands. Likely these lineages represent at least three and possibly multiple species, which have higher conservation value than currently recognized.  The species complex has been introduced to such distant places as Borneo, Sulawesi and Seram, and even Madagascar (Wogan et al 2015). However, more work is required to determine species delineations and even which species have been introduced.

This Species was featured in News of the Week 18 July 2022: 
Amphibians are generally considered saltwater intolerant, although many amphibian species are found in coastal areas. How will climate changes such as increasing temperature, sea levels, and storm surge events impact amphibian survival? Using three coastal frog species (Duttaphrynus melanostictus, Fejervarya limnocharis and Microhyla fissipes), Chuang et al. (2022) tested the effects of salinity on both tadpole survival and the ability to withstand high temperatures (critical thermal maxima or CTmax). They found in all species exposure to high salinity treatments lowered survival, the maximum temperature that tadpoles could withstand, and development rate. Their study shows that rising temperatures and increased salinity exposure might be a double whammy for tadpoles. This study highlights the importance of including and measuring multiple stressors in climate changes studies because environments are predicted to change in multiple ways that can have compounding effects on organisms.

Adults are usually large, stout-bodied toads, 110-187 mm long from snout to vent. Their olive skin is smooth, leathery, and scattered with small rounded tubercles often set in rust colored spots. Behind the angle of the jaws there is at least one conspicuous white tubercle. The length of each paratoid gland is twice the paratoid width, and equal to the distance from the nostril to the tympanum. On the dorsal surfaces of the limbs there are several enlarged glands that resemble the paratoids. Above each eye curves a distinct cranial crest.

Found from southern Arizona(USA), through most of Sonora to northern Sinaloa (Mexico). Its range extends into the southeastern parts of California, USA and the northeastern corner of Baja California, Mexico. These toads are primarily found in the desert, but also occur in grassland and low elevation oak-woodland. They frequently take refuge in rodent burrows. Though they often breed in temporary pools, they appear to be dependant on the presence of a permanent water source.  
 
 
 
 

","
Primarily nocturnal.
These toads appear in Tuscon just prior to the summer showers, and congregate once the rains begin. They breed in temporary pools, croaking incessantly. Males have a reduced vocal sac and their call is weak. Their tadpoles are strikingly different from those of related species Bufo boreas and B. canorus, being gray or golden brown. The larval period is believed to be no more than a month. Their diet includes beetles, grasshoppers, spiders, small lizards, Bufo cognatus and Scaphiopus couchi.

Habitat destruction and possibly pesticide use have caused populations to become extinct.  Collecting by certain groups is also a threat to populations in some areas. In California, populations occur along the Colorado River, which have been severely depleted. It is listed as a State Species of Special Concern (CA DFW 2019).
 

","
The glands of the toads produce a toxin (5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine or 5-MeO-DMT) that can cause hallucinations in humans, and therefore is a controlled substance.

This species was featured as News of the Week on 24 February 2020:

Smoking the dried secretions from toads is known for its psychedelic effects and recent investigations indicate it may alleviate depression, anxiety, and symptoms of PTSD. Uthaug et al. (2019) sought to determine the sub-acute and long-term therapeutic applications of the dried toxins from the Colorado River Toad Incilius alvarius, which has high concentrations of the psychoactive compound 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (or 5-MeO-DMT). The authors implemented a series of questionnaires before and after (up to 24-hour and again at 4-weeks post) a single inhalation of the substance in a naturalistic setting. Participants were more satisfied with their lives and had improved mental states immediately after their experience and these feelings were still present at the 4-week survey.  Depression and anxiety decreased to a significant degree 4-weeks post exposure. Clearly investigations into  5-MeO-DMT for its therapeutic benefits continue to show promise.

 Bufo biporcatus  has a moderately-sized but stout body.  The females of this species are typically larger than the males.  The females have a snout-vent length of 60-80 mm, while males have a snout-vent length of 55-70 mm.  Members of this species exhibit two elongated supraparietal ridges between the eyes; the species' name is derived from these ridges.  Small and distinct parotoid glands are present. The skin is wrinkled and covered with tubercles.  The tympanum is visible and may be circular or somewhat elliptical. Toes are half-webbed (Iskandar, 1998) except for the fourth toe (Church, 1960a).  Dorsal coloration is brown (may be a reddish or grayish shade), mottled with darker blotches. Male  B. biporcatus  generally have red throats (Iskandar, 1998). The color pattern is lighter in populations from east (Lombok) to west (Bali, Java) within the species range (Church, 1960a). 
 
The tadpoles are small, with the tail usually no longer than double the head plus body length, and a denticle formula of I+1-1/III. Papillae are confined to the corner of the mouth, and the mouth is not adapted for stream-dwelling  
(Iskandar, 1998). 
 

","
This species is endemic to Indonesia and is found in Sumatra, Java, Madura, Bali, and Lombok, as well as having been introduced in Sulawesi.   It occurs at lower elevation (up to 700 m) in both primary and secondary forest, as well as in areas of human habitation on Bali and Lombok.  In Java it tends to be restricted to more forested regions 
(Iskandar, 1998). 

","
Males call at night from the water (Marquez and Eekhout, 2006), especially during a full moon (Iskandar, 1998). Usually groups of 2-3 males call, separated by 1-1.5 m (Marquez and Eekhout, 2006). Advertisement calls usually consisted of 8-10 paired, complex pulses (Martin's Type II; Marquez and Eekhout, 2006; Martin, 1971), with occasional calls of 4 or 6 pulses. The dominant frequency of the advertisement call was about 1.7 kHz, with an average duration of 567 msec, a pulse rate of 9.1 pulses per second and an intercall duration of 1363 msec. 
 
This species also has a release call, which consists of a series of pulses with an average duration of 16 msec.  The dominant (and fundamental) frequency of the release call was about 1.5 kHz, and two or three harmonics were present, every 0.5-0.6 kHz.   
 
Call factors with low variation (both within and between individuals) are likely to convey information useful for species recognition, while call factors with high variation may convey information about the status of individual males. For Bufo biporcatus, the dominant frequency shows low between-individual variation, while pulse rate is more variable and may give females a basis on which to choose males (Marquez and Eekhout, 2006). 
 
 Bufo biporcatus  is found in or near flooded rice sawahs, pools and streams (Church, 1960).  This species prefers to lay eggs in stagnant water.  Females of this species lay several hundred eggs in a string (Iskandar, 1998).  
Once the eggs hatch, the duration of the larval period has been reported to be 39 days for  
B. biporcatus in Sarawak (Inger, 1966). 

","

","
Although  B. biporcatus  is relatively abundant, agriculture and logging present threats.  It is also vulnerable to competition. In Bali, introduced B. melanostictus were reported to displace or eliminate B. biporcatus wherever the two species came into contact, particularly in drier, more open and urban areas (Church, 1960b).
","

","
 Bufo biporcatus  is related to the following species:  B. claviger ,  B. parvus ,  B. philippinicus ,  B. divergens , and  B. quadriporcatus .  In particular, Bufo clavicus and B. divergens resemble B. biporcatus, but B. claviger has an enlarged interorbital ridge behind the eyes, and B. divergens is smaller with a noticeably sloping snout. 
 
The diploid chromosome number is 22, consisting of five pairs of large chromosomes plus six pairs of smaller chromosomes.

Bufo fustiger is a member of the Bufo peltocephalus group. These toads have brown, tan or chocolate brown dorsal surfaces with tan to yellow vermicular patterns. These patterns are diffuse and vary from wide to wormlike. While the dorsum is covered with low and rounded (but not spinose) tubercles, the dorsum of the head is uniformly brown. The venter is dull gray and also tuberculate. The limbs are banded, with the antebrachium, thigh, crus and pes each possessing two bands. The anterior and posterior faces of the thighs are light tan and mottled with brown blotches. Juveniles have gray-brown dorsal surfaces with two white dorsolateral stripes and some irregular, darker brown markings. The adult cranial crests are low. An anterorbital notch is present at junction of supraorbital and canthal crests. The irises are brilliant green. The upper lip is not flange-like; the chin and lower lip are cream-colored. The tympanum is large and the parotoid glands are enormous, placed diagonally behind the head casque. Adults are large, reaching lengths of 198 mm in females and 148 mm in males. It is the larger of the Antillean toads (Schwartz 1960; Ruiz 1987; Valdes 1989; Schwartz and Henderson 1991).

Bufo fustiger is a nocturnal toad, taking refuge by day between and under rocks and palm trunks. Males vocalize from the ground while positioned among the roots of riparian vegetation. They form loud choruses on the shoreline of mountain streams and other bodies of water. Breeding males have nuptial excrescences on their thumbs. The amplexus is axillary. The eggs are laid in double strings with each egg measuring about 2 mm in diameter. Calls consist of periodic notes containing two or three amplitude modulations. The dominant frequency is around 0.7 kHz. These calls are like a â€œcoc, cloc, croc, croc, co-croc, co-croc, co-croc,â€ with the beginning notes shorter and the terminal notes more rapid. Food includes beetles and other insects, slugs, scorpions (Rhopalurus junceus), vinegaroons (Mastigoproctus sp.) and vegetal matter. It is able to inflate itself to prevent ingestion by predators (Schwartz 1960; Armas 1987; Ruiz 1987; Valdes 1989; Schwartz and Henderson 1991; Alonso and Rodriguez 2003).

These toads have a brown or reddish brown dorsal surface with bold yellow reticulations. The dorsum also has low, rounded non-spinose tubercles. The dorsum of the head is uniformly brown, with a cream-colored chin and lower lip. The upper lip is not flange-like. The venter is dull gray and tuberculate. The limbs are banded, the antebrachium, thigh, crus and pes each with two bands. The adult cranial crests are low. An anterorbital notch is present at the junction of the supraorbital and canthal crests. The tympanum is large and the parotoid glands are very large, and placed diagonally behind the head casque. The juvenile pattern is very different from the adult pattern, with the dorsum either vivid green or reddish brown, with three prominent pairs of blotches and a black interocular triangle. The adult size is large, averaging 163 mm in females and 128 mm in males (Ruiz 1987; Schwartz and Henderson 1985; Schwartz and Henderson 1985 1991)

This species is endemic to Cuba, Isla de la Juventud and ArchipiÃ©lago de Sabana-Camaguey. This species is found from Matanzas province to the easternmost tip of Cuba, from sea level to moderate elevations. It occurs in forests, cultivated fields, along stream banks and around rural houses. It is also commonly found near the ocean.
","
These toads are nocturnal, with activity peaks between 22:00 and 23:00 hours and 01:00 and 03:00 hours. By day, these toads remain under rocks, in soil cracks, culverts, drain pipes, under palm trunks and trash, in cavities they excavate, and even in burrows of Speotyto cunicularia (Burrowing owls, SijÃº de sabana). Males vocalize from the ground, forming dense choruses in the edges of shallow, slowly running streams and flooded ditches. Calls consist of periodic notes containing two or three amplitude modulations. The dominant frequency is around 0.7 kHz. These calls are like a â€œpap-pap-pap,â€ giving rise to the vernacular Cuban name. Breeding males have nuptial excrescences on their thumbs. The amplexus is axillary; the eggs are laid in double strings. Food primarily includes Hymenoptera (especially ants) and Coleoptera, although other groups are also included, such as the following: Blatoptera, Lepidoptera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Diptera, Diplopoda, Arachnida, Chilopoda, Crustacea, Gastropoda and Oligochaeta. Flatworms (Mesocoelium crossophorum), tapeworms (Batrachotaenia bufonis) and nematodes (Abbreviata baracoa, Aplectana hamatospicula, Neyraplectana sp., Oswaldocruzia lenteixeirai, Rhabdias elegans) parasitize this species. It can inflate itself to prevent ingestion by predators (Lando and Williams 1969; Valdes 1978; Valdes and Ruiz 1979; Coy and Lorenzo 1982; Sampedro et al. 1982; Sampedro and Berovides 1985; Ruiz 1987; Valdes 1989; Schwartz and Henderson 1991; Alonso and Rodriguez 2003).

 Bufo asper  has a large and stout body.  The females have a snout-vent length of 95-140 mm, while the males have a snout-vent length of 70-100 mm. The skin is covered with warts or tubercles; the name of this species derives from its rough skin texture.  The head is broad and blunt, without bony crests. This toad has an ovoid parotoid gland connected to the supraorbital ridge by a supratympanic ridge.  The tympanum is visible. The hands and feet are spinous.  The fourth toe is the longest, and all the toes except the fourth are fully webbed. Males have nuptial pads on the base of the first finger.   Bufo asper  is usually dark brown, gray or black in color, with black spotting ventrally.  Males have a blackish coloring on their throats  
(Iskandar 1998; Inger and Stuebing 2005; Inger and Bacon 1968).   
 
Bufo asper tadpoles are small, reaching 12-15 mm before metamorphosis.  The body is oval and somewhat flattened.  The tail is leaf-shaped, rounded with a narrow tip.  The lower lip is quite wide  
(Inger and Stuebing 2005), with the cuplike mouth enabling the tadpole to adhere to the bottom substrate in flowing water  
(Iskandar 1998).  The denticle formula is II/III. Tadpole coloration is either all black or dark brown  
(Iskandar 1998).
","
This species can be found in primary and old secondary rainforests of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and Borneo, up to 1500 m above sea level (Iskandar, 1998; Inger et al., 1974). It has also been reported to occur in Vietnam, at the border of Gia Lai and Dac Lac provinces to the northwest of Plei Tung Than; in Vietnam it occurs at about 700 m in elevation  
(Nguyen et al. 2005).  It is likely also to occur in intervening Cambodia and Laos, but has not yet been reported from these countries.   Bufo asper  lives along banks of small to medium-sized streams (3-30 m wide) and large rivers  
(Inger at al. 1974).  
","
Bufo asper is nocturnal and partially aquatic, coming out at night and hiding under submerged stones during the day (Iskandar, 1998).  It lives along stream banks rather than wandering through the forest, almost always remaining within 2 m of the water's edge  
(Inger et al. 1974).  On Bornean streams, the median home ranges vary from 43-75 m  
(Inger et al. 1974). 
 
Males call to females from widely spaced sites along the stream banks at night, particularly when there is a full moon  
 
(Inger 1969; Iskandar 1998).   
The call has been described as a raspy chirp, which is sometimes repeated  
(Inger and Stuebing 2005). They do not form choruses  
(Emerson and Hess 1996).  This species appears to reproduce year-round, as both sperm and eggs are produced throughout the year  
(Inger and Bacon 1968). Ripe ova have a diameter of 1.26 mm  
(Inger and Bacon 1968).  This species lays huge clutches, with an average size of 12,792 eggs per clutch  
(Inger and Bacon 1968).  Bufo asper prefers to lay its eggs in quiet portions of streams, as  
metamorphosing larvae were found at the edges of side pools of streams in Borneo  
(Inger et al. 1974). The tadpoles are somewhat flattened, and typically adhere to the bottom of streams with slow to medium currents using their subterminal, cuplike mouths.  The lips are enlarged, enabling bottom feeding 
(Iskandar 1998).  
 
Bufo asper adults do not move much on a given day  
(Inger and Stuebing 2005).  However, these toads have been found to show net movement (distance between the point of first and last capture over a given time period) of up to 465 m over a period of 180 days  
(Inger 2003). It has been hypothesized that this vagility may have allowed Bufo asper to disperse between the continent and Borneo over relatively short periods of sea regression during the Pleistocene  
(Inger 2003). 
","

","
This species is quite resilient.  Although  B. asper  is affected by habitat loss and pollution, it has managed to survive in areas where many other frog species have disappeared, particularly on Sumatra and Java  
(Iskandar 1998; IUCN 2006).  However, populations in Malaysian forest fragments were shown to have a relative lack of genetic diversity (vs. B. parvus and B. melanostictus), which reflects the coincidence of Bufo asper breeding and feeding areas, linear home ranges, and lack of breeding aggregations  
(Inger et al. 1974).
","
This frog is consumed for food in Sabah and peninsular Malaysia  
(IUCN 2006).
","
Skin toxins from Bufo asper were able to induce the following significant
effects on mice at a dose of 100 mg/mouse: locomotor difficulties, prostration,
and convulsions, with partial recovery after 5 hours.  The major toxic component
in Bufo asper skin extracts is bufotalin (a bufadienolide), with a lesser
component of resibufogenin and minor amounts of other bufadienolides and
bufotoxins  
(Daly et al. 2004). 
 
The diploid chromosome number is 22, with five pairs of large chromosomes and
six pairs of smaller chromosomes  
(Iskandar 1998).

Bufo haematiticus is a moderate to large-sized toad, with adult males 42 to 62 mm and adult females 50 to 80 mm in SVL.  This species can be distinguished by the lack of cranial crests, having large parotoids, the presence of a distinct inner tarsal fold, and a ""dead leaf"" color pattern of light above and a broad dark lateral band (Savage 2002).

The head is as broad as it is long with large parotoid glands that are elongated, equal in area to the side of the head, and covered with pustulate warts. No cranial crests are present. Limbs are long. Finger I is longer than finger II; no webbing on any fingers. Single subarticular tubercles are present but supernumerary and accessory palmar tubercles are lacking. Toes are webbed at the base, with single rounded subarticular tubercles on the toes but no supernumerary or plantar tubercles.  Inner metatarsal tubercle elongated, outer metatarsal tubercle small and rounded. There is a distinct inner tarsal fold. Dorsal surfaces and parotoid glands have warts and pustules. Adult males have a single internal subgular vocal sac that is fully distensible and a single vocal slit on either right or left. On the thumb, males have a brown nuptial pad (Savage 2002). 

The dorsum has a coloration of tan to purplish gray, which may be uniform or marked with black spots and/or burnt orange blotches. The parotoids are a slightly lighter shade than the dorsum. The iris is dark brown to black with gold flecks. A white line outlines the top of a dark brown-black lateral stripe that runs from the tip of the snout along the side of the head and flank to the groin. The venter is light beige to yellow, often shading into burnt orange with dark brown marks on the chest (Savage 2002).

Larvae are small with an ovoid and somewhat depressed body, reaching 21 mm in total length at stage 37. Mouth is anteroventral, nostrils anterolateral, and eyes are dorsal. Lateral, sinistral spiracle, and medial vent tube. Tail long with low fins and a rounded tip. Oral disc small and emarginate, with beaks and 2/3 denticles, showing a broad A2 gap above the mouth. A single row of labial papillae is present lateral to the mouth. Dark brown dorsal coloration with clear venter. Dark tail musculature with clear fins (Savage 2002).
","
Distributed on the Atlantic versant from eastern Honduras to northern Colombia   and on the Pacific slope from Costa Rica to central Ecuador, at elevations from 20 to 1,300 meters a.s.l. (Savage 2002). In Venezuela it occurs in the Sierra de PerijÃ¡ (Barrio-AmorÃ³s 2004). This species is found in lowland and premontane moist and wet forests, on the forest floor (Savage 2002). It can occur in disturbed areas but only near intact forest (SolÃ­s et al. 2004). Metamorphs and juveniles can be found under rocks along streams (Savage 2002). 
","
This species is nocturnal and breeds explosively in the early to middle wet season (March to July) (Savage 2002). It prefers to breed in rocky pools that border forest streams and large rivers (Savage 2002). Eggs are laid in single-file paired strings and have black and cream pigmentation (Savage 2002). No advertisement call is known but a possible release call has been described as a series of high-pitched peeps (IbÃ¡Ã±ez et al. 1999). 

Bufo haematiticus consumes small ants, mites, beetles, and other arthropods ranging from 0.4 to 4.8 mm in length (Savage 2002). 
","

","
The population trend is decreasing. Although Bufo haematiticus is described as abundant in Costa Rica (SolÃ­s et al. 2004), it is also described as occurring at low density at La Selva, Heredia Province, Costa Rica (Savage 2002), and as having been extirpated at Monteverde, Costa Rica (Pounds et al. 1997).  Population numbers are declining in Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Chiriqui, Panama, and this species is uncommon in Honduras (SolÃ­s et al. 2004). It is relatively common in Nicaragua. In Columbia and Venezuela, Bufo haematiticus is rare but has been recently reported (SolÃ­s et al. 2004).

 The main threats are habitat destruction and degradation due to agriculture, cattle ranching, and wood extraction, although this species does occur in several protected areas. It can sometimes be found in disturbed habitat as long as intact forest is adjacent. In Venezuela its habitat is threatened by dams and in Colombia oil pollution is a problem. Chytrid fungal infections have been detected in this species at Fortuna, Panama (SolÃ­s et al. 2004).
","

","
The karyotype is 2N=22.  Chromosomes are metacentric to submetacentric. Five pairs are noticeably shorter than the others. Secondary constrictions are found on chromosomes 1, 4, and 7 (Bogart 1972).

B. chavin is characterized by having large, elevated, elongate glands on each forearm and tibia, two large, elevated, elongate glands on the outer dorsal margin of each foot and aone small, elevated gland on the outer dorsal margin of each hand.  Snout-vent lengths ranged from 54.8 to 64.9 mm for females and from 47.5 to 52.0 mm for males.
Individuals exhibit considerable color variation.  The dorsal and lateral ground color ranges from shades of brown to green with brown, grey, green or white spotting.  The throat, chest, venter, and extremities are sulphur-yellow, cream, light brown or grey with dark brown, dark grey and white blotches and spots.  The ventral surfaces of the hands and feet are olive-brown or chestnut.  Some have a middorsal line. 


","
B. chavin was collected from two cloud forest localities, at 3010 and 3017 m, from the eastern Andean slopes of central Peru.  These localities are described as ""bosques framentados"", or naturally fragmented forests.

A large robust toad (adult male :100-166 mm;  adult female : 135-190 mm). Body stout; strong cephalic crests and large parotoid glands on head. Tympanum small, higher than wide. Skin of dorsum scattered with blunt thorny warts, especially in males;  dorsum yellowish in females and juveniles with a regular pattern of black blotches and a wide light-colored middorsal stripe. The color of the male dorsum is often a bright greenish yellow with only a few black blotches; belly white, marbled with brown. 

","
The rain forest (Mata AtlÃ¢ntica) of southeastern and southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, and also in Misiones (Argentina). Usually in elevated forests, also in grassland. During breeding time, they are found in streams and standing water bodies, such as lakes, ponds or puddles.
","
Spawning period from August to January. In November and December hundreds of the diurnal, only 9-10 mm sized, recently metamorphosed froglets leave the breeding places en mass. Males call in and at water bodies, mainly at night but also during the day. The call is a melodious tremolo (pointed out by the indigenous name â€œCururuâ€). The large egg strings with several thousand dark-colored eggs are deposited at shallow water. The small, black, free-swimming larvae live in large congregations, feeding on suspension and grazing on stones and aquatic plants. Most of adult toads are â€œSit-and-Wait-Predatorsâ€ feeding on invertebrates especially Coleoptera and Formicidae.
","

","

","

","
Toads from the Eldorado locality, in Misiones, near the ParanÃ¡ borders, show remarkable morphological peculiarities, with characters both of Rhinella (Bufo) schneideri, as the shape of the dorsal warts or the presence of tibial glands, and of Rhinella ictericus, as the parotoid shape or the dorsal pattern. More available biological data are needed to make clear the identity of such a mixed or intermediate population.

This species was featured in News of the Week October 18, 2021:
Amphibians are known for their very permeable skin that functions in gas and water exchange. Frogs, in particular, have colonized very dry habitats worldwide that  would create seemingly conflict between the need for oxygen uptake (required for metabolism) and water loss (potential desiccation). To better understand how frogs, and especially their skin, cope with dry habitats, Mailho-Fontana et al. (2021) compared the skin, physiology, and behavior of two closely related toad species, the Yellow Cururu Toad and Cope's Toad (Rhinella icterica and R. jimi, which is now known as R. diptycha, respectively) that experience different climates. The authors found that the Cope's Toad from drier climate regions had thicker and more glandular skin, showed lower rates of water loss and displayed stereotyped behaviors to increase water uptake when dehydrated. These findings link differences in form, function, and behavior to illuminate strategies for desiccation resistance in frogs.  (MWomack)


This species was featured in News of the Week 14 August 2023:
Amphibians are found across a wide range of elevations, from sea level to above 5,000 meters, exposing them to a wide range of climates. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that organisms exposed to more temperate variation will be able to function across a wider range of temperatures. Bovo et al. (2023) tested the thermal tolerances of five species of frogs that are distributed across mountains in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest in a variety of microhabitats, including Boana faber, Dendropsophus minutus, Leptodactylus latrans, Physalaemus cuvieri,  and Rhinella icterica. They found differences among species in temperature tolerance, but did not always find that broader temperature variation at increasing elevations correlated with broader temperature tolerance. In addition, they did not find a consistent difference in water loss or water uptake across altitude or climates. Overall, they did not find strong support for the climate variability hypothesis or for elevation shaping these physiological traits. (MWomack)

[Description originally from Rhinella martyri , now a synonym of R. margaritifera (Pereyra et al. 2021).]
A large toad species of the Bufo (Rhinella) margaritifera group. (1) SVL of females 64.7 +/- 3.4 mm, of males 55.3 +/- 5.8 mm; (2) protruding bony knob at the angle of jaws; (3) canthus rostralis with a crest, concave laterally; (4) heel just reaches posterior margin of eye when hindlimbs adpressed; (5) cephalic crests hypertrophied in females and postorbital crests laterally extending and very distinct in males; (6) neural spines protruding in females, distinct in males; (7) tympanum large round or ovoid but smaller than eye diameter; (8) parotoid glands relatively small, triangular, posteriorly elongated; (9) upper eyelid without projections; (10) toes about three-quarters webbed, three phalanges free on toe 4; (11) tarsal fold absent; (12) skin tuberculate on dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces, more spinous on limbs; (13) oblique row of tubercles extending from posterior end of postorbital crest to groin; (14) snout pointed dorsally and acute laterally with small fleshy ridge going from tip of snout to the upper lip; (15) iris golden with black reticulations (Fouquet et al 2007).

This species is highly polymorphic. The coloration of the back varies from dark brown to light gray and sometimes even reddish. The patterns are also very variable, with a variety of leaflike patterns with successive shades of dark to light brown or gray. A whitish middorsal stripe can occur and can be very thin to 5 mm wide (Fouquet et al 2007).
","
Primary and secondary rainforest of south-western French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, as well as Brazil (Amapa and probably northern Para), Colombia, Ecuador,  and probably north-eastern Venezuela.
","
This abundant species reproduces in temporary ponds and along the flooded beds of rivers during the rainy season. Males call from the ground after heavy rainfall at dawn and night. The advertisement calls are around 295 ms long and composed of approximately 6 groups of pulses on average. These pulses are usually in pairs except the last pulse group that comprises more pulses (up to six). The frequency (mean=1.17 kHz) increases during the call while the time between pulse groups decreases.  Amplexus is axillary.

Fouquet et al 2007 noted the similarity and allopatry of Rhinella martyri with R. margaritifera, although slight morphological differences exist in the shape of the head, the body size and the supratympanic crests in females (see Fouquet et al. 2007). In 2021, Pereyra et al. synonymized R. martyri with R. margaritifera by implication.

Females of this large bodied species can attain snout-vent lengths of over 225 mm, though most adults range from 85 to 150 mm. Adult males are smaller and yellowish-brown in color, with the yellow being most pronounced along the sides and the throat. Females and immature males have irregular brown blotches on their dorsal surface. The skin of both sexes is covered by irregularly scattered warts. In sexually active males these warts bear horny spicules. The parotoids are relatively large and often triangular and swollen in appearance. Cranial ridges are well developed.  The tympanum is distinct, and the interorbital is concave.  The webbing is poorly developed.  The nuptial pads in the males are dark on the first 3 fingers (Easteal 1963).  










","
Naturally occurring populations are found from the southern tip of Texas and northwestern Mexico to central Brazil. Introduced populations have been established in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. Upper altitudinal limits vary with latitude, from 500 m in Sinaloa, Mexico to 1600 m in Venezuela  (Easteal 1963). Bufo marinus was introduced to Northern Queensland, Australia in 1929 and has since spread throughout much of the continent (Lampo and De Leo 1998).










","
The mating call is long and has 12 notes/sec.  The dominant frequencies are .35 and .7 kHz without frequency modulation to clear harmonics (Cole et.al. 1968).

Potential Impacts: This toad is highly toxic, secretions from the skin serve as a natural defense against predators. The toxin is stored in the ovum, not the jelly coat. The toxicity of cane toads shifts rapidly during the course of their lifetime. Toad eggs are extremely toxic, while later-stage tadpoles were less toxic.   Animals that bite these toads are often seriously affected, many are killed. Domestic dogs and cats often are killed by the toxins.  Native wild animals are also affected especially in places where the toads are introduced (especially in places like Australia and in Florida, USA).  Marine toads may compete with and prey upon native amphibians (Rabor in Krakauer, 1968). 
As an invasive species, cane toads have the potential to bring harmful viral pathogens to native fauna. Scientists found that cane toads carried three of the 14 protozoan species of neotropical origin. Cane toads in Australia also contain nematode lungworm, a parasite endemic to the Americas. While these pathogens and parasites could potentially infect native frog species, observations show that infection has not spread to other native species.  
In addition to the direct impacts that cane toads may have on native fauna, the cane toad may also have indirect impacts on food webs and population dynamics. For example, predation on dung beetles by cane toads could reduce dung breakdown rates, affecting many aspects of ecosystem function. Toad invasion can massively reduce the population of predators such as varanid lizards, elapid snakes, freshwater crocodiles, and northern quolls that die from consuming cane toad toxins. 

Metamorphosis occurs in tadpoles between 14 and 28 days after hatching, depending on the water temperature. Eggs hatched late in the dry season will metamorphose before the late wet season, when food is most readily available and moisture stress is reduced (Lampo and De Leo 1998). After metamorphosis these toads leave the water and seek diurnal refuges to avoid dehydration and predation. B. marinus uses hollow trees for shelter during the dry season and dense vegetation during the wet season in addition to rock crevices which are used throughout the year (Seebacher and Alford 1999). These toads show more nocturnal activity and travel greater distances per night in Australia than in South America (Seebacher and Alford 1999). 

Introduced to many localities in the first half of the 20th century as a means to control sugar cane pests, these toads have undergone a population explosion. They have established widespread ranges in these non-native areas and attain higher densities in Australia than they do in their native range (Lampo and De Leo 1998). This has caused much concern about the effects of B. marinus on native anuran species. The eggs and hatchlings of B. marinus are toxic to many native predators in Australia. The predatory frog species Limnodynastes ornatus showed decreased survivorship where it co-occurred with B. marinus. However Limnodynastes rutella, which is preyed upon by L. ornatus, showed increased survival rates (Crossland 2000).  Bufo marinus can inhabit open land near human habitations and sugarcane fields. 

B. marinus is an opportunistic feeder, and readily feeds upon land snails as well as centipedes, cockroaches, beetles, grasshoppers, ants, and small field mice. Stomach samples of this species in particular areas of the world show that terrestrial gastropod prey can comprise over 40% of the stomach contents (Hinckley 1963; Bailey 1976; Grant 1996). In laboratory trials under wet conditions, it was found that B. marinus readily consumes a range of camaenid snail species. This makes it unique from other anurans that typically do not prey upon molluscs. While some scientists have proposed that B. marinus consumes vertebrates (e.g., ground-nesting birds such as bee-eaters), this has been found to be very rare. In follow-up studies, cane toads avoided (rather than selected) birds and their eggs as prey (Merops ornatus: Boland 2004).
B. marinus is primarily diurnal in activity, and lacks defense against ant species that are immune to toad toxins. Freshwater crayfish, adult dytiscid diving beetles, dragonfly larvae, and mosquitoes are among other native invertebrates that feed upon the cane toad without ill effects. However, leeches and aquatic snails that feed on larval or adult toads often die from the toxins that are consumed. It should be noted that other invertebrates vary in their susceptibility to toads. Some dytiscid diving beetle larvae can consume hatchlings and tadpoles while others die. Belastomatid giant water bugs can consume some developmental stages of tadpoles without ill-effect, but not others.
Cane toads can serve as an additional food source to vertebrates. Snakes like the keelback (Tropidonophis mairii) and slatey-grey snakes (Stegonotus cucullatus) can consume the cane toads without dying, but keelbacks do show ill-effects. When given a choice, keelback snakes prefer native frogs to cane toads (Llewelyn et al. 2009b). Similarly, raptors consume road-killed toads, but preferentially select native frogs when given a choice. Water rats and introduced black rats frequently consume cane toads. 
Most species of Australian freshwater fish often mouth and spit out cane toad early life stages without apparent ill effects. For the fly-specked hardyhead (Craterocephalus stercusmuscarum), the banded and spangled grunters (Amniataba percoides and Leiopotherapon unicolor respectively), the purple-spotted gudgeon (Morgurnda adspersa), glassfish (Family Ambassidae), western rainbowfish (Melanotaenia australis), and black catfish (Neosilurus ater), consuming cane toad eggs or tadpoles are toxic. However, most fish avoid cane toad early life stages because they can detect their noxiousness. For most fish, toad eggs are likely to be more lethal than toad tadpoles. 
In 1975, Covacevich and Archer reported that saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) could ingest cane toads without ill-effect, while freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) died after mouthing or ingesting cane toads (Begg et al. 2000). In 1990, Freeland found that C. johnstoni actively hunts and ingests cane toads. It was later reported in 2009 that the deaths of some freshwater crocodiles in the Daly River were due to toad ingestion. A population-level impact study found 34 dead freshwater crocodiles in the Victoria River caused by cane toad ingestion (Letnic et al., 2008). Evidence included a wave of crocodile deaths moving upriver and coinciding with the areas in which cane toads were invading, as well as toad remains found in the stomachs of some of the dead crocodiles. 
Turtles also vary in their tolerance for cane toad toxicity. In some cases, turtles ingest toads without ill effect, while other predation attempts by the same species result in fatality. The long-neck turtle (Chelodina sp.) ate a dead cane toad without ill effect, while the saw-shelled turtles (Elseya latisternum) and Krefft's river turtles (Emydura krefftii) consumed toad tadpoles and were also unaffected. In a study by Kruger, long-necked turtles (Chelodina rugosa) seized and spit out toad tadpoles and survived, yet died after consumption of toad eggs. 
The area of Australia invaded by cane toads contains high densities of lizards belonging to several phylogenetic lineages. The impact of toads across the lineages is highly nonrandom. Fatal poisoning occurs in three lineages: the Varanidae (goannas), the Scincidae (skinks), and the Agamidae (dragons). Varanids often grow to large body sizes and are therefore more likely to attack a large cane toad more readily than a lizard from most other lineages. Varanids often die after ingesting or mouthing cane toads. Most species of scincid lizards have a relatively small adult body size. Due to their small body size, most Scincid lizards are unlikely to be at risk from consuming a cane toad large enough to kill them. However, some species such as the bluetongue skink (Tiliqua scincoides intermedia) readily consume small toads and die as a result. 
Snake species at risk from cane toads are frog-eating species that cannot tolerate toad toxins, can swallow toads large enough to be fatal, and whose geographic distribution overlaps with that of the cane toad. Using this criteria, 49 snake species were found to be potentially at risk from toad invasion. The toad invasion is a potential threat to 70% of the Australian colubrid snakes, 40% of the pythons, and 41% of the elapids. Nine of the species that were deemed ""at risk"" are currently recognized as threatened species on a federal or state level. Recent work on the feeding patterns of snakes in captivity have shown that species that were previously identified as potentially at risk species were reluctant to take cane toads as prey, or immediately rejected the cane toad after striking it. Colubrids and pythons appear to be less at risk than the elapid snake species, with high mortality rates in death adders (Acanthophis praelongus), black whip snakes (Demansia papuensis), and king brown snakes (Pseudechis australis)(M. Greenlees et al. unpubl. data in Shine 2006). 
In 1975, Covacevich and Archer reported that some crows (Corvus sp.) and kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae) died after mouthing cane toads, while other individuals of the same species consumed young or road-killed toads without showing any ill effects. At least seven native bird species can eat toads successfully. Reasons for this tolerance may be because they eat only non-toxic parts of the toad or because they are immune to the toxins. In 1997, Dorfman predicted that 76 species in the Kakadu National Park were potentially under threat from cane toads. However, more recent studies by Beckmann and Shine in 2009 have concluded that cane toads appear to have minimal impact on Australian birds. The ability to survive toad invasion may be due to a widespread physiological tolerance of bufotoxins, perhaps reflecting close genetic ties between Australian birds and taxa in Asia, where many bufonid species are similar in toxicity to the cane toad. 
In 2004, Webb and Glanznig listed nine species of native mammals and two species of introduced mammals as potentially at risk from cane toad ingestion. Due to previous reports of domestic dogs dying from mouthing cane toads, dingos may also be at risk. Feral cats and pigs also may be negatively affected by cane toads. In captivity, native rodents (Melomys burtoni, Rattus colletti, R. tunneyi) readily killed and consumed small toads, but did not appear to suffer any ill effects. Other rodents (Must domesticus, Pseudomys nanus, Zyzomys argurus) did not attack cane toads as prey at all. Small dasyurid marsupial species, like planigales (Planigale ingrami, P. maculata) and dunnarts (Sminthopsis virginiae) initially attacked toads, became ill as a result, and were later reluctant to attack toads. Relatively few of these dasyurids died as a result of attempting to ingest toads. The species of mammal that is most often a victim of toad invasion is the northern quoll, Dasyurus hallucatus. Lethal ingestion of cane toads is responsible for the local extinction of northern quoll populations in the Mary River region of Kakadu National Park. One study showed that only four of 14 quolls that died from toad ingestion, suggesting that perhaps other factors may be playing a role in quoll extinction. However, more recent studies show that seven out of eight quoll deaths resulted from ingestion of cane toads. In addition, quolls have been killed by toads in areas where very few toads were spotted, suggesting that even in low toad density areas, quolls are still threatened. 
Cane toad impacts are affected by attributes of toad biology. Cane toads have a multiphasic life history. Eggs and tadpoles reside in waterbodies, metamorphs are only found in riparian areas, and larger juveniles and adults occupy large areas of drier landscape. In addition, the types and amounts of toxins present in toads vary throughout their lifetime. One specific feature of the cane toad is that their highly toxic eggs are coated in a non-toxic jelly, fooling aquatic predators into consuming them when they would otherwise be able to detect bufotoxins in their prey (Greenlees and Shine 2010).
There also seems to be competitive interactions between cane toads and three species of native tree frogs around waterholes in the Gulf of Carpentaria: Litora pallida, L. rothii, and L. rubella. Evidence suggests that cane toads are likely to have a more adverse impact on larger terrestrial frogs like Cyclorana australis and Limnodynastes convexiusculus. These impacts may be caused by direct behavioral interference rather than competition for food. In a study done in 2009 by Pizzatto and Shine, nine out of ten native frog species avoided sites scented by cane toad chemical cues (all except Litoria rubella), and in 2007, Greenlees et al. found that the presence of  cane toads reduced the nocturnal activity levels of the native frog Cyclorana australis. Sexual harassment of female frogs by male toads is also known to occur between native and introduced taxa in other phylogenetic linages (e.g. Valero et al. 2008). In addition to competition involving native anurans, other vertebrate species may also compete with toads for limited resources. In 2004, Boland suggested that cane toads may compete with the nesting burrows of bee-eaters, Merops ornatus. 
Cane toads were first introduced into northern Australia in 1936, and have rapidly spread across 1.3 million square kilometers of northern and eastern Australia since (Urban et al., 2007). In northern Australia, toad population expansion has accelerated steadily, from approximately 10 to 55 kilometers per year. On the invasion front, toads move far distances (up to 1.8 km per night), and mostly move in straight lines, actively using cleared areas such as roads as dispersal corridors (Brown et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 2007). This expansion behavior can be compared with toads from older populations. Currently, invasioni front individuals move more often, travel farther per move, and tend to move in straighter lines. However, environmental correlates do not adequately explain these changes (Urban et al., 2008). In order to test whether these differences in behavior resulted from evolution or just plasticity associated with new toad environments, an experiment was created. The dispersal rates of parent populations during the cane toads invasive history was measured and compared to dispersal rates of the offspring. Through this collection method, researchers hoped to minimize environmental effects on on dispersal ability and estimate the heritability of dispersal. 184 toads were radiotracked over two seasons. Toads with larger bodies consistently moved farther than toads with normal or smaller body sizes. The breeding cohort resulted in high levels of variance in daily dispersal of the adult toads. This suggests that differences in birth date can have large influences in dispersal.The estimate of mean within-population genetic variance was large and suggested a narrow sense heritability of 0.24. In addition, there was a log mean daily displacement in this species with a large 95% interval of 0.02-0.72. Thus, there is evidence to suggest that there does seem to be a heritable variance within toad populations for dispersal. This selection on disperse could produce evolutionary change.  
Female anurans have been shown to be the choosier sex, selecting mates that show good resource defense techniques or attractive male displays. However, the only way that females can exercise mate choice is by approaching a male with an attractive call or mating site. When a female approaches such sites, she may be intercepted by a ""satellite"" male that attempts to mate with the female by grasping her in amplexus (Wells 2007). This is particularly common in areas of high density. In a recent study conducted with B. marinus, it was found that perhaps females are not just passive participants in the mating process, but rather have a mechanism of exercising control. Evolutionarily, frogs and toads are able to protect themselves from predators by inflating their bodies. This increased girth may deter predators who may be threatened by an anuran that is too large to ingest. Similarly, female anurans frequently inflate their bodies when being amplexed from males. In this sense, the female cane toads could facilitate male-male competition by reducing the ability of undesirable mates to grasp onto her.  In females who were unable to inflate their bodies, the small ""satellite"" male was aable to grasp onto the female despite takeover attempts by larger rivals. Body size of mates is a factor in female mate choice because fertilization success is highest when the males and females are close in size. Since females are the larger size, choosing a larger male increases the fitness of their offspring. Larger males are often able to displace smaller males, but smaller males rarely displace larger rivals. However, smaller males can resist takeover attempts if the female does not inflate her body. Therefore, this study shows that takeovers by larger males can show female and male tactics in sexual selection.

According to the Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA), this species is of least concern with regards to extinction and its population is actually increasing. There are currently no significant threats to this species. Some animals that have been introduced to Puerto Rico carry salmonella, putting species that consume them at risk. In Bermuda, survival and development of tadpoles are being negatively affected due to contaminants in ponds and the transfer of accumulated contaminants (Bacon et al. 2006).

Humans are affected by the toxic skin secretions.  Symptoms include irritation of the skin and burning of  the eyes (Wright and Wright, 1949; Krakauer, 1968, 1970; Behler, 1979; Carmichael and Williams, 1991; Conant and Collins, 1991).

Marine toads have probably been introduced more widely than any other amphibian in the world (Behler, 1979; Carmichael and Williams, 1991). They have been introduced as a control agent for insects that damage sugarcane (Riemer, 1959; Krakauer, 1968; King, 1970), however, since they are nocturnal and many sugarcane pests are diurnal, they are not effective biocontrol agents.  For information on introductions into Australia, please see Cane toad-Australia.

Human perceptions of the cane toad are largely negative, with many fearing its size, appearance, and potential invasive impact on Australian communities. Between 1986 and 1996, the state and federal government spent more than $9,500,000 (Shine et al. 2006) and enormous efforts by volunteers to control local toad populations by collection. However, these negative community perceptions of invasive species impacts are often in error. In actuality, the direct impact of cane toads falls heavily on a small number of native taxa, not a wide spectrum of native fauna. Others suggest a more direct effect on humans by claiming that toads are poisoning waterholes with their toxins and are even leading to drug abuse for humans that become addicted to licking the toads or smoking their dried skins (Clarke et al. 2009). However, there are no data that actually supports these claims. 

Recently, humans have thought that a native predator, the meat ant (genus Iridomyrmex), could control the invasive cane toad populations. In an experimental setting, 98% of metamorph toads encountered at least one predator ant species in a high density ant environment, while 87% of metamorph toads encountered at least one predator ant species in a low density ant environment. Most of these toads were attacked, with 82.5% killed at high density and 51% killed at low density. From these data, it appears as though high ant density is more effective at controlling cane toad populations. There are multiple reasons to explain why this may have occurred. First, higher density inevitably leads to more encounters. In addition, at higher ant densities, ants are more likely to swarm onto a prey item. Lastly, higher ant densities increase the body-size threshold at which metamorph toads shift their defense mechanism from the active escape tactic to crypsis. As a result of this higher ant density, more toads of a wider range of body sizes are killed. 

In the field, smaller metamorph deaths were most commonly observed. This may be because small metamorphs have a less effective response to ant attack and are also more vulnerable to disease and parasites, such as lungworm (Kelehear 2007), as well as dessication (Child et al. 2008). In addition, the low level of toxins in metamorphs make them even more susceptible to predator attack.

However, it should be noted that meat ants alone are not entirely feasible for controlling cane toad populations. Meat ants are only effective at killing metamorph toads, and may be less effective during the wet-season recruitment events. Increased ant densities might even serve as a food source for adult cane toads. Many are also cautious because using biocontrol in other instances have often vastly negatively affected ecosystems in ways that could not have been predicted. In this instance, the predator is already a native species and is simply being redirected to areas with high populations of cane toads. But reduced or increased populations of ants in certain areas may still affect native fauna, and meat ants can still competitively exclude ecologically similar ant species.

How do frogs swallow their food? While the mechanics of the frog tongue are well-studied for the prey capture phase of the feeding cycle, little is known of how structures in the mouth move once it is closed. Recent work by Keeffe et al. (2022) investigated the functional morphology of the hard and soft tissues involved in feeding behaviors in the Cane toad, Rhinella marina. Using a combination of high-speed X-ray video, 3D animation software, and dissection, they assessed the role of the skull, jaw, pectoral girdle, tongue, and hyoid apparatus (skeleton supporting the tongue) during a complete feeding cycle. Their results suggest the hyoid apparatus plays an important role in prey transport, potentially helping remove prey from the sticky tongue pad prior to swallowing. They also found that the tip of the tongue consistently travels behind the back of the skull during swallowing, and that tongue protrusion comprises only a small portion of a full feeding cycle. This work raises new questions about the evolution of feeding in frogs, as well as how the observed diversity across frogs in the skeleton of the shoulder and tongue may influence feeding kinematics.

The introduction history of cane toads to Australia is well documented; however, their introduction history in North America is unclear. Mittan-Moreau et al. (2022) sequenced Rhinella spp. populations across five introduced and five native populations to identify possible sources for North American introductions and the evolutionary consequences of introduction. They found the introduced Rhinella species in Florida is more closely related to Rhinella horribilis than to Rhinella marina (the source of all other known cane toad introductions). All introduced populations of toads had slightly lower genetic diversity than native populations, and showed genetic signals of population bottlenecks (sudden, rapid declines in population size) in their recent history. Nonetheless, introduced Florida populations showed less severe population declines (>500, at the lowest point) than had been reported by an oft-cited 1955 newspaper article describing an accidental release of just 100 toads. Lastly, genetic variants that may be under selection in introduced populations are largely present in native populations, suggesting that adaptation in the new, introduced environment may be enabled by genetic diversity already present in native populations. This study highlights the utility of genetic sequencing in understanding species introduction history, and the role of pre-existing genetic diversity in population persistence and expansion.

Cane toads (Rhinella marina) were famously introduced to Australia as a potential biological control in 1935. Because Australia lacks bufonid frogs, these toxic toads have very few natural predators in Australia and have consequently rapidly expanded across the continent while achieving spectacularly high densities (more than 10 times greater than in their native range in South America). DeVore et al. (2021) show that this lack of predators in Australia has changed the selection regime for cane toads in a manner that has established an intraspecific co-evolutionary arms race. Cane toad tadpoles compete for food resources. In their natural South American range, tadpoles opportunistically consume smaller, more vulnerable early stage tadpoles. However, in Australia, this competitive interaction has been escalated dramatically â€“ larger tadpoles are 2.5 times more likely to consume smaller tadpoles. Furthermore, Australian cane toad tadpoles have uniquely evolved an attraction to early-stage tadpoles mediated by the presence of maternally-invested toxins (e.g., bufadienolides) in the smaller tads. Indeed, in laboratory experiments, Australian cane toad tadpoles were 29.5 times more likely to enter traps baited with smaller cane toad tadpoles than were native South American tadpoles. The authors note that cannibalism is no longer an opportunistic behavior in Australia: Australian tadpoles shift to a targeted foraging strategy aimed at locating and consuming conspecifics as soon as they chemically detect the presence of smaller tadpoles. This strategy not only provides a rich nutritional resource, but does so while simultaneously removing future competitors.  (Written by Jim McGuire)

If you have ever picked up a male cane toad (Rhinella marina) you likely heard it make a noise termed a 'release call'. It is thought these calls send a message to other males- ""I'm a male, release me!""â€“ if a male cane toad is grasped by another male to mate. However, Kelehear and Shine (2019) found that about one-third (205 of 625) of male can toads in their study did not emit a release call when clasped. The male cane toads that did not produce a release call were smaller and had poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, indicating they were likely non-reproductive juveniles. Building on previous work that showed males will release males sooner than females, regardless of a release call, Kelehear and Shine hypothesize that other male-specific cues (such as skin rugosity) provide secondary release cues. Shine and Kelehear further propose that eavesdropping predators, such as nocturnal rodents, may cue in on release calls to find cane toad prey. Thus, for large, reproductively active males, time is of the essence during mating season and release calls ensure much less time is wasted being clasped by another male. However for smaller, less reproductively successful male cane toads, not calling may waste some time but costs very little compared to being a rodent's meal (Written by Molly Womack).

While vehicular collisions on roads are known to kill numerous wildlife each year, railroads have received substantially less attention, particularly with respect to amphibians. Dornas et al. (2019) examined toad fatalities across an 871-km railroad segment in the Brazilian Amazon, one of the last few large wildlife refuges with minimal landscape development. The researchers recorded 9,091 Cururu toad (Rhinella jimi, R. marina, and R. schneideri) carcasses along the railroad, an average of 2,273 toad killed by the railroad per year, over a four-year period. Interestingly, not all toad carcasses showed signs of being hit by moving trains. Many toads died by barotrauma, where sudden changes in air pressure due to rapidly moving train violently pushes air against toads, everting their stomachs out of their mouths and killing them. Small toads were also desiccated because they were too small to climb and move across the railroad tracks to find moist shelter. In general, toads are most vulnerable to railroads during the transition between the dry and wet seasons as they migrate. By experimentally manipulating carcasses, the researchers showed that this railroad likely causes over 10,200 toad fatalities per year with 8-12 toads kill per km of railroad each year. This study highlights railroads as a particularly lethal threat to amphibians, even in relatively undeveloped landscapes (Written by Max Lambert).

The snout-vent length can reach 250 mm for females, with males slightly smaller, reaching 180 mm (Norman 1994). The head is short and broad, with distinct cephalic crests (Lutz 1934).  The skull has broad frontoparietals whose lateral edges form distinct supraorbital crests, which then extend forward onto the nasal bones to form canthal and preorbital crests (BrandÃ£o et al. 2007). Both supraocular and retroocular crests are present, the supraocular crest forming an obtuse angle with the retroocular crest (Lutz 1934).  
The snout is rounded in dorsal view and truncate in profile. A distinct tympanum is visible, slightly smaller than the eye itself. Behind the eyes are large bean-shaped parotoid glands (Lutz 1934). The pupil is large and slit-shaped (Norman 1994). 

 The body is globular, short and stout (Norman 1994). Limbs are short, and the hind legs are weak. A tibial gland, which secretes a milky bufotoxin, runs down each hind leg (Lutz 1934). Fingers/toes are fairly slender and the inside toes and fingers are bent outwards. There are no expanded discs. There is no webbing on the fingers, but there is very minimal webbing between the toes. The relative length of the digits is as follows: II>III>I>IV for fingers, and V>IV>III>I>II for toes. There are no tubercles on the fingers or toes. Males have nuptial pads on their thumbs (Norman 1994). The skin is rough, covered with blunt, spiny warts that are usually conical (Norman 1994). These abundant warts are light near the bottom and spotted with black on the top (Lutz 1934). 

Dorsally, B. schneideri is brownish to yellowish (Norman 1994). The belly and throat are whitish and closely speckled with dark spots.
Along the middle of the back are chocolate brown transverse blotches or spots. The sides and the dorsum have whitish spots and reticulations, with fewer on the dorsum. Males may also have large black spots dorsally (Lutz 1934).

Tadpoles are 24.31 mm +/- 1.26 mm at stage 36 to 38. 
The body is oval and depressed when viewed dorsally, and globular/depressed when viewed laterally.  The snout is rounded in dorsal view and sloped in lateral view. Eyes are dorsal and directed laterally. Nares are large, oval-shaped and directed dorsolaterally, with a very small projection on the marginal rim. Nares length is greater than 1/2 the diameter of the eye. The spiracle is medial and laterally directed, with the opening located at two-thirds of the body length. The vent tube is short and medial, and fused with the ventral fin. The dorsal fin distinctly rises during the last third of the tail, and the ventral fin is low. The tadpole's oral disc is anteroventral and emarginated laterally. Papillae are small and triangular, with a row of submarginal papillae sometimes present. The tooth row formula is 2(2)/3(1), where A-1 and A-2 are equal in length and P-2 is slightly longer than P-3. The jaw sheaths are narrow, with triangular serration. The upper jaw is arc-shaped while the lower jaw is u-shaped (Rossa-Feres and Nomura 2006).
 
The tadpole body is gray (Cei 1980) while the tail is dark with translucent fins (Rossa-Feres and Nomura 2006).

This species is known from North and Central Argentina (Missiones, Corrientes, Chaco, Entre RÃ­Â­os, Formosa, Jujuy, Salta, Santiago del Estero, Cordoba, Santa Fe, and TucumÃ¡n), central Bolivia (Beni, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Santa Cruz, Tarija), and the Atlantic coast of Brazil (from CearÃ¡ to RÃ­Â­o Grande do Sul), Paraguay, and Uruguay (Artigas, Salto, Paysandu, RÃ­Â­o Negro, and Soriano). It has been found at elevations up to 2,000 m asl. It occurs in a wide variety of habitats, from open, urban areas to the Chaco, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest regions (Stuart et al. 2008).

Bufo schneideri is nocturnal and terrestrial. It occasionally burrows in deep soil. It climbs on rocks and roots. Its dry, rough skin, burrowing habits, and activity at night all allow B. schneideri to live in drier regions of South America (Norman 1994).
It breeds from October to April, although the rainy season lasts only from October until March. Bufo schneideri is thus one of the few species in the genus Bufo which is able to breed during the dry season.
The advertisement call is a low resonant trill resembling the sounds of a stake being rapidly hammered.  Males also give a slightly higher pitched release call if other males mount them, with the release call being a low ""squeegeeing"" noise, like a window being washed. Bufo schneideri vocalizes throughout the year, while most other species only vocalize and reproduce during the warm, rainy period (Norman 1994).  

The female deposits her eggs in a pool of temporary or permanent open water without much vegetation (Stuart et al. 2008).  Eggs are laid in long strands in the bottom of the water. The clutch is large (well over 2,000 eggs) and the eggs may occur in double rows (Caldwell et al. 2007). The eggs hatch as tadpoles.  Bufo schneideri tadpoles eat planktonic algae, unlike other bottom-dwelling tadpoles that consume periphytic algae. At night, the tadpoles have been seen swimming upside down just below the water's surface (Rossa-Feres et al. 2004). 

Snakes and other predators eat Bufo schneideri. It can puff up with air to avoid being swallowed by snakes, and its brownish color works as camouflage. The bufotoxin it secretes can cause nausea, vomiting, and even paralysis and death in potential predators (Norman 1994).

The species is fairly abundant (Stuart et al. 2008).

While vehicular collisions on roads are known to kill numerous wildlife each year, railroads have received substantially less attention, particularly with respect to amphibians. Dornas et al. (2019) examined toad fatalities across an 871-km railroad segment in the Brazilian Amazon, one of the last few large wildlife refuges with minimal landscape development. The researchers recorded 9,091 Cururu toad (Rhinella jimi, R. marina, and R. schneideri) carcasses along the railroad, an average of 2,273 toad killed by the railroad per year, over a four-year period. Interestingly, not all toad carcasses showed signs of being hit by moving trains. Many toads died by barotrauma, where sudden changes in air pressure due to rapidly moving train violently pushes air against toads, everting their stomachs out of their mouths and killing them. Small toads were also desiccated because they were too small to climb and move across the railroad tracks to find moist shelter. In general, toads are most vulnerable to railroads during the transition between the dry and wet seasons as they migrate. By experimentally manipulating carcasses, the researchers showed that this railroad likely causes over 10,200 toad fatalities per year with 8-12 toads kill per km of railroad each year. This study highlights railroads as a particularly lethal threat to amphibians, even in relatively undeveloped landscapes (Written by Max Lambert).

Schismaderma carens, commonly known as the Red Toad, is a moderate to large-sized toad.  Males can reach 88 mm, and females can reach 92 mm in snout-vent length.  This toad has a less warty back than many toads of the same size.  A distinct dorsolateral glandular ridge runs from above the tympanum to the hind leg.  The outer part of the dorsolateral ridge is darker on the lower edge.  The tympanum itself is large and round, with a diameter approximately equivalent to that of the eye.  Parotoid glands are not visible. A tarsal fold is present. Breeding males have vocal sacs, as well as nuptial pads on their first three fingers for amplexus (Channing and Howell 2006).   


The back is characteristically marked by a pair of small dark brown spots on the lower back and another pair of markings on the shoulders.  Dorsal coloring is reddish, hence the common name of Red Toad.  The ground color is pale brown and even pinkish at times.  The flanks are either pale or very dark.  The underside is speckled with gray (Channing and Howell 2006).

The tadpole has an unusual horseshoe-shaped flap of skin on the head (Channing 2001).



","
Schismaderma carens is widely distributed throughout Central and Southeast Africa.  The northern-most parts of its range cover northwestern Tanzania and Olorgesailie in southern Kenya.  The species occurs down through southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, eastern Angola, and Western Zambia, and also reaches southeastern Botswana, southern Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.  Although it has not been recorded in Lesotho, it also possibly occurs there (Poynton et al. 2004).

The Red Toad tolerates a broad range of habitats, but occurs primarily in grassland and wooded savannah.  It also occurs on livestock ranches, around human settlements, and on agricultural land.  This species is terrestrial and breeds in freshwater.  Its breeding grounds are usually bodies of deep, still water, including dirty water (Poynton et al. 2004).

","
Although the Red Toad is common, it is much easier to find when it is breeding (Poynton et al. 2004).  Calling occurs predominantly in the midsummer, and the males call while floating in the shallow water to advertise themselves to females (Channing and Howell 2006).  The call sounds like a loud, long whoop, with a duration of 0.9-1.2 seconds and dominant harmonics between 0.1 and 0.8 kHz.  Calls are made during the day.

After heavy rainfall, the toad breeds during the day in deep muddy water.  Males reach the breeding grounds, among the younger vegetation in the deep water, before the females.  Dense spacing is the norm, with males separated by as little as 300 mm from each other.  The males proceed to call and chase each other, while actively trying to mate with other frogs.  Females then enter the area in response to the calls.  The eggs are laid in a double string during amplexus while the pair moves slowly in the water, producing rows of egg strings.  Eggs may be attached to vegetation, and females leave shortly after laying their eggs.  The clutch size is 2500, with each egg 1.6-2.5 mm in diameter.  Since myriad toads lay their eggs at similar times, the waters may be filled with upwards of tens of thousands of eggs at a time.   
The period of development from egg to toadlet ranges from 37 to 52 days.

The Red Toad has gregarious tadpoles, sometimes found in mixed swarms with tadpoles of the African bullfrog Pyxicephalus adspersus.  These tadpoles are unique morphologically due to a horseshoe-shaped flap of skin on the head (Channing 2001; Channing and Howell 2006).  

The adult molts at 4 day intervals (Channing and Howell 2006).


","

","
The Red Toad is a fairly abundant and widespread species that is not currently threatened.  The tadpoles may be preyed upon by dragonfly nymphs, helmeted terrapins (Pelomedusa subrufa), the hammerkop (Scopus umbretta), and hinged terrapins (genus Pelusios).  The savanna vine snake Thelotornis capensis eats juvenile Red Toads, while the white-lipped snake Crotaphopeltis hotamboeia and the eagle owl Bubo lateus consume adult toads (Channing and Howell 2006).  


","
The Red Toad often lives in very close proximity to humans.


","
The specific name carens is Latin for ""lacking"" and refers to the lack of parotoid glands (Channing and Howell 2006).  Other common names include the Red-backed toad, African split-skin toad, kazoli in Lwena and Manganja, conga in Sena, naliwonde in Yao, rooiskurwepadda in Afrikaans, and zonde in Chewa. 

Biochemical evidence suggests that S. carens has been separated from other toads evolutionarily for approximately 55 million years (Channing 2001).

Adult males are 21 to 25 mm SVL while adult females range from 25 to 32 mm.  Distinguishing characteristics of this species include the presence of vomerine teeth; long snout with an obtuse profile; a white parietal peritoneum, but colorless hepatic peritoneum; absence of free prepollex, humeral hooks, and humeral spines; presence of well-developed fleshy fringe on posterior and ventral edges of lower arm, hand, lower hindlimb, and foot; green bones in life; dorsal coloration a deep blue-green covered with many raised, moderate-sized yellowish-white tubercles (Savage and Starrett 1967). 

 General characteristics of this species are (1) head rounded in outline from dorsal view; (2) vomerine teeth in series between choanae; (3) tongue small and round; in males paired vocal slits posterior and laterally positioned to tongue; (4) snout long, obtuse in profile; nostrils positioned laterally, inclined upward; (5) eye orbit round, twice diameter of tympanum; pupil horizontally elliptical; membranes transparent; directed forward, completely visible from frontal view, interorbital space about half of head length; (6) tympanum round, directed laterally; (7) canthus rostralis rounded, loreal region slightly concave; (8) distinct fleshy fringe along posteroventral edge running from elbow to disc of finger IV; (9) undersides of palms and fingers smooth, with lateral fleshy margins; (10) palmar tubercle smooth and round, ulnar tubercle elongate; (11) discs wide and truncate on fingers, small and round on toes; (12) webbing between fingers III and IV, and on all toes; (13) hindlimbs long, also with distinct fleshy fringe posteroventral from heel to disc of toe V; (14) elongate inner, but not outer metatarsal tubercle present; (15) throat and chest smooth; in males, wrinkled at single external vocal sac; (16) venter and thigh undersides strongly granulated; (17) below anus, distinct fringe-like ridge forms 2 raised tubercles and a series of small tubercles (Savage and Starrett 1967).

 Dorsal surface deep blue-green with many yellow-white to bright yellow spots; iris ivory; ivory white border along lip, arm and leg fringes; white subanal ornamentation; ventral side pale yellow-white; abdominal region transparent revealing visible white parietal peritoneum and white viscera (Savage and Starrett 1967).

Tadpoles have long tails, elongate bodies, and are pale in color (Savage and Starrett 1967).
","
These frogs occur from central Costa Rica through Panama to western Colombia from 90-1650 m asl (IUCN 2008). The type locality is Canton de Coronado, in the Provincia de San JosÃ©, Costa Rica, at 1500 m asl (Savage and Starrett 1967). Within western Colombia, it is found in the departments of Choco, Antioquia, and Risaralda (Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch 1991; Ruiz-Carranza et al 1996). Habitat ranges from subtropical to tropical wet forest, rainforest, and moist forest (Savage and Starrett 1967).
","
Males call from low trees or bushes overhanging fast flowing streams during the rainy season; calls have been heard from August to October at the type locality, Canton de Coronado. The call resembles that of C. granulosa and consists of one, two, or three unmusical notes, rapidly repeated, and blurred in quality: ""creep, creep, creep"" (Savage and Starrett 1967). 

The adult female paratype was found to contain black and white ova, similar to those of  C. granulosa . Egg clutches were collected, at the same time as males who were calling were collected. Eggs were suspended in jelly masses from leaf tips. Clutches were kept and reared until the tadpoles reached 24 mm in size (Savage and Starrett 1967). 

This species is considered rare in Costa Rica and Panama but abundant in Colombia (IUCN 2008).
","

","
It occurs within protected areas in all countries where it is found (Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia). In Panama, it is threatened by deforestation (IUCN 2008).

Diagnosis: Small dark blue-green dorsum, generally with scattered black spots.  Snout is obtuse in profile. Dark green bones. White stripe on upper lip. Parietal peritoneal sheath, pericardium, and digestive tract white (Savage 2002).

Description: Adult males 22.5-29 mm SVL, adult females 29-32 mm SVL. Head wider than long. Snout is rounded in dorsal view, obtuse in profile. Nares are not protuberant and are directed dorsolaterally. Eyes are large but not protuberant. Interorbital width considerably exceeds the eye diameter. Tympanum is round and indistinct. Vomerine odontophores are round with only a few teeth present, and are located between choanae.  Finger I is slightly longer than Finger II. Both finger and toe discs are truncated. Fingers I and II have no webbing in between, but there is vestigial webbing between Fingers II and III, and more developed webbing between Fingers II and IV. Toes are moderately webbed. There is no tarsal fold or tubercle present. No fringing is present on arms or legs. Dorsal skin surfaces are very granular. Males have a large, well-developed white nuptial pad on the dorsal and outer lateral margin of the base of each thumb (Savage 2002).
 Coloration is dark blue-green, with scattered black spots usually present. Parietal peritoneal sheath covering anterior internal organs, white pericardium, and white digestive tract are present. Liver is reddish. Bones are dark green. Upper lip has a white stripe. Iris is pale gray-gold (Savage 2002).

Eastern Honduras to central Panama, and northern Costa Rica to southwestern Panama (KÃ¶hler 2001; Savage 2002; McCranie and Wilson 2002; McCranie 2007; Kubicki 2007), in the moist lowlands and premontane slopes at 40-1,500 m asl (Savage 2002).

Although Cochranella granulosa is found in Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama, there are few records from Honduras and Nicaragua (SolÃ­s et al. 2008). 
","
Cochranella granulosa is a nocturnal species (Savage 2002). Males call from trees 5-10 m above fast-flowing streams (Savage 2002). The call is a series of rapid harsh notes ""creep-creep-creep"" at a dominant frequency of 4-4.5 kHz (Savage 2002). Eggs are generally laid arboreally above streams in a single-layered jelly mass approximately 20 X 35 mm, with each clutch containing 49-60 eggs (Savage 2002), although this species also occasionally breeds in ponds (Guayasamin et al. 2009). Eggs are black and white and measure 1.5 mm in diameter by themselves or 3 mm with the envelope (Savage 2002). The jelly mass hangs over the edge of the leaf, forming a drip tip so that water constantly flows over the eggs (Savage 2002). No long-term parental care is provided (Savage 2002).  The tadpole is a detritivore that burrows in deposits of organic materials (Altig et al. 2007).
","
Larvae are 11 mm at stage 25 with an elongated and slightly depressed body. Nostrils and eyes are dorsal. Spiracle is located sinistrally and is much closer to the posterior margin of the body than the eye. Vent tube is located in the middle. Mouth is ventral. A complete oral disc, beaks, and 2/3 rows of denticles are present. Lower beak has large blunt serrations. A2 is restricted to two short segments on either side of the mouth. P3 is equal to or only slightly shorter than other posterior tooth rows. A single row of labial papillae is present around the sides and bottom of the oral disc but not above mouth. The tail is long with reduced caudal fins and a round tip (Savage 2002; Lips and Savage 1996).

Upon hatching, larval coloration is black.  As the tadpole matures, it becomes pale brown with translucent fins; the fins have sparse dark spotting toward the posterior (Savage 2002).
","
This species is found in a number of protected areas, but in the rest of its range it is threatened by severe deforestation (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).  It requires primary forest (Furlani et al. 2009). Water pollution also presents a threat (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).
","

","
The specific epithet granulosa is derived from the Latin word granulum, meaning small-grained or granular, referring to the granular skin of this species (McCranie and Wilson 2002).

The karyotype is 2N = 20 (Duellman 1967).

Espadarana prosoblepon is a medium-sized centrolenid frog (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007), measuring  21-28 mm in males and 25-31 mm in females.  The head is broader than it is long, with a truncate snout, and appears round when viewed from above (Savage 2002).  The eyes are large and bulging, with a horizontally elliptical pupil (Leenders 2001), and the space between the eyes measuring less than the diameter of one eye (Savage 2002). The tympanum is indistinct. Vomerine teeth are present in a slightly diagonal patch between choanae, separated medially (Savage 2002).  Bones and intestines are visible through skin, although the intestines are less discernible because they are covered by a white membrane, the parietal peritoneal sheath (Leenders 2001; Savage 2002).  The skin is smooth, although there are two regions where the skin becomes granular: on the belly below the vent and on the ventral surface of the thighs.  On the thighs, the granular skin surrounds cloacal ornamentations (a pair of warts, one on each thigh) (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).  

Finger I is longer than finger II. The fingers and toes have truncate discs, and the disc on finger III usually has a diameter equal to that of the eye (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007). Fingers are webbed, although there is no webbing between fingers I and II.  A bubble-like structure called the â€œbullaâ€ is embedded in the webbing between the outer fingers (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).  Toe webbing is moderate. The webbing formula for fingers and toes is as follows: Fingers = II 2-3 Â¾ III 2 Â½-1 Â½ IV. Toes = I 1+-2 Â½ II 1 Â½-1 Â¼ III 1 Â¼-2 Â¼ IV 2 Â½-1 Â½ V (Savage 2002).  On the hand, the thenar tubercle is elongate, and the palmar tubercle is round and large; on the foot, the inner metatarsal tubercle is small, flat, and elongate, and the outer metatarsal tubercle is small and ovoid. There is no tarsal tubercle.  A well-developed nuptial pad is present on outer lateral and dorsal surfaces of the thumb base in adult males (Savage 2002). Breeding males also develop conspicuous, abundant spicules.  All males have a sharp, protruding spur on the upper arm called the humeral spine. Females and juvenile males will sometimes exhibit an underdeveloped version of the spine (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).  
Dorsal surfaces are emerald green, usually with black flecks.  False ocelli, (irregular light spots surrounded by ill-defined dark borders, which form a reticulated pattern) are present in some specimens (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007). Finger coloration is slightly paler than the dorsum (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).  The ventral coloration is yellow (Savage 2002).  Bones are green because of the presence of biliverdin (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).  The iris is gray/silver (Leenders 2001) and has a fine, dark reticulation (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).      
	At stage 25, the total length of the tadpole is 12.3 mm (Starrett 1960).  The larval body shape is elongate and somewhat depressed, with a long, rounded tail and very low fins (Starrett 1960). Tadpoles have dorsal, C-shaped eyes and dorsal nostrils (Starrett 1960).  The mouth is ventral and nearly terminal, with wide, papillate lips (Starrett 1960).  It has a complete oral disc with medium-sized beaks and 2/3 rows of denticles present (Starrett 1960; Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007). The spiracle is midlateral, posterior, and sinistral (Starrett 1960).  The vent tube is long and medially located (Starrett 1960).  

At hatching the tadpole is black (Starrett 1960), with the coloration changing later in development to a pale brown dorsally; the ventral coloration is lighter but can appear bright red (Savage 2002).  There are brown dorsal and lateral streaks on the musculature and fins anteriorly, with uniform coloration posteriorly except for the fin margins (Starrett 1960).   

","
This species is found along the Caribbean from Honduras to Colombia, and along Pacific slopes from Honduras to Ecuador (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). It is found at elevations ranging from 20-1,900 m in humid lowland, premontane and lower montane zones of wet and moist forests and rainforests (Savage 2002).  The preferred habitat consists of densely vegetated areas of lowland and foothill seasonal and non-seasonal evergreen forests, and semideciduous evergreen forests, along the banks of fast-moving streams (Savage 2002; Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).  
","
The males are very territorial and will each occupy a space on the streamside at intervals of approximately 3.2 m, with spacing determined by calling (Savage 2002).  Males vocalize from leaf perches and are most vocal during the wet season, from May to November.  The calls consist of a rapid and condensed ""dik-dik-dik"", given at a relatively low rate of 1 to 43 calls per hour (Savage 2002).  Note duration is 1.5 to 3 seconds, and the dominant frequency is 5.3 to 6.0 kHz (Jacobsen 1985).   

If one male invades anotherâ€™s territory, the two males will wrestle with their arms while dangling upside down, holding onto vegetation with their legs (Savage 2002).  Wrestling can last up to thirty minutes, ending when one male drops from the vegetation or signals submission by flattening his body against a leaf substrate and then leaving (Savage 2002).  
	
 Breeding occurs during the rainy season, May to November (Savage 2002).  The male initiates amplexus by jumping on the femaleâ€™s back and grasping her, while continuing to call (Savage 2002).  The pair may stay in one place or move up to 2 m away (Savage 2002).  This species is oviparous.  Egg deposition takes place from approximately 2:30 am until sunup, and occurs on the upper surfaces of leaves, moss-covered rocks, or branches, from 0-3 m above the water (Savage 2002).  Starrett (1960) also reported a clutch fastened between two leaves, with the upper leaf partially covering the clutch. Each egg (including the envelope) has a diameter of about 10 mm (Starrett 1960). A clutch consists of about 20 black eggs, and is laid in a monolayer about 50 mm in diameter, with a thin, loose film of jelly covering the clutch (Starrett 1960).  Females initially stay with the clutch for minutes or hours, but once they leave, neither parent returns (Savage 2002).  After 10 days, tadpoles hatch from the eggs and drop into the stream underneath (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).

Hyalinobatrachium chirripoi occurs in the lowlands of southeastern Costa Rica (Kubicki 2004), Honduras (eastern Olancho and eastern ColÃ³n, McCranie 2007, as H. cardiacalyptum), eastern Panama (IbaÃ±ez et al. 2000), and western Colombia (Jarado and Bahiasolano, in Choco Department, Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996) . It is found in lowland moist forests at altitudes of 0-700 m asl, in bushes and trees along forest streams (SolÃ­s et al. 2004; Frost 2010). 
","
Adult females lay eggs on the underside of smooth-leaved plants that hang over streams. Males call from below palm leaves 1-4 m above water. The call is an insect-like high-pitched buzz (Kubicki 2004). 
","

","
Although Savage (2002) considered this a rare species, it appears to be common in Costa Rica and stable in population numbers (SolÃ­s et al. 2004).  In Costa Rica, there appear to be no threats to this species, due to the fact that it appears to tolerate disturbed habitats well (SolÃ­s et al. 2004). Some populations in Panama and Colombia are threatened by habitat loss due to increasing agricultural cultivation and logging (SolÃ­s et al. 2004).

Diagnosis: Small lime-green frog with yellow spots, protuberant eyes, snout markedly truncate in profile and with an indented tip in dorsal view, and fleshy narial openings lying on distinct raised ridges. Pericardium colorless. Can be distinguished from H. chirripoi by having less finger webbing (vs. extensive finger webbing in H. chirripoi) (Savage 2002).

Description: Adult males are 23-27 mm in SVL, while adult females are 24.5-29 mm in SVL. This frog has a broad head and a truncated snout, with the snout tip indented when viewed from above. The nasal region is distinct and swollen, and nostrils open in raised fleshy protuberances that lie on elevated ridges. Eyes are protuberant as well. Interorbital region is wider than the snout length. The tympanum is indistinct and directed dorsally. Finger I is longer than Finger II. Webbing between Fingers I and II is vestigial and present but reduced between outer fingers. Toes are extensively webbed. Finger and toe discs are truncated. Subarticular tubercles are small and rounded. Supernumerary, accessory palmar, and plantar tubercles are not present. The inner metatarsal tubercle is elongated but the outer metatarsal tubercle is absent. In adult males, a white nuptial pad of separated glands is present on the outer surface of the thumb base. There is no tarsal fold present.  Dorsal surfaces are shagreened (Savage 2002).
 Coloration is lime-green on the upper surfaces with small yellow spots. The venter is transparent. The undersides of limbs are white. The parietal pericardium is clear, while the liver and digestive tract are white. Iris is gold (Savage 2002). 
 Larvae are small and are only 9.5 mm at stage 25. The body is elongated. The tail is long with a pointed tip. The spiracle is low, posterior, and sinistral. The vent tube is located in the middle. The mouth is located ventrally with a complete oral disc. Beaks and 2/3 rows of denticles are present. The lower beak is finely serrated. There is a single row of papillae around the oral disc, excluding the upper portion. A2 has a very large gap above the mouth (Savage 2002; Jaramillo et al. 1997). 
Larvae are clear chocolate brown dorsally and lighter below. The underside appears pink due to blood circulation. The caudal musculature has dark flecks on the anterior dorsal surface, which mark the myosepta and are also found in the groove between the epimeric and hypomeric musculature.

Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum is found on the Atlantic versant near Catamacas, Departamento de Olancho, Honduras (McCranie and Wilson 2002; McCranie 2007; as H. crybetes); in central and southeastern Costa Rica (Kubicki 2007); on the western slope of the Cordillera Occidental in Colombia (Departments of Antioquia, Boyaca, Caldas, Choco, Cordoba, Risaralda, Tolima and Valle del Cauca; Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996), south to Valle del Cauca; and in ColÃ³n Province, Panama (Jaramillo et al. 1998; IbaÃ±ez et al. 2000). It occurs at elevations of 6-1,800 m asl (Savage 2002).  Its habitat is humid lowland and montane forest, where it is found in vegetation (trees and bushes) along forest streams (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).
","
Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum is a nocturnal insectivore. It is usually found on the undersides of leaves associated with small streams. Breeding season is from May to November, during rainy season. The advertisement call is a single, sustained trill that lasts 600 to 800 milliseconds and is repeated after a pause. The dominant frequency is 4.4 to 4.6 kHz (Savage 2002). 

Males are territorial and call from the same site (or very nearby) during the entire breeding season. Call frequency increases three-to fourfold if a nonresident male enters the territory. If an intruder does not retreat, there is physical contact until one male presses the other's venter to the leaf and the loser then leaves (Savage 2002). 


Eggs are laid on the underside of the leaf from which the male calls (Savage 2002). Clutches usually contain about 50 eggs (maximum 75), each with a diameter of about 1.5 mm excluding the gelatinous envelope (Savage 2002). Egg masses are not guarded during the day, but at night males call and visit their clutches (Savage 2002). Occasionally, the male climbs on an egg mass and touches the eggs with ventral, pelvic, and thigh areas (Hayes 1991).  Presumably he is engaging in hydric brooding (voiding liquid onto the eggs to keep them moist) since eggs and jelly are noticeably swollen after the male's contact (Hayes 1991). When tadpoles hatch, they fall into the stream below where they complete development (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).

Diurnal wasps are predators of Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum egg masses. Wasps remove a single egg from the mass and fly off. Entire egg masses can be consumed in this manner over repeated visits, since clutches are not guarded during the day (McDiarmid 1978).
","

","
There are currently no major threats to Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum, although certain populations may be under pressure from habitat loss due to deforestation.  This species is generally common and occurs in a number of protected areas. The Monteverde, Costa Rica population experienced a significant decline in the 1990s, but this population has partially recovered (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).

Hyalinobatrachium colymbiphyllum was first described by Taylor (1949). Hyalinobatrachium crybetes was synonymized with this species by Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid (2007).

Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni is a relatively small frog with males ranging from 19.2 to 25.5 mm (Wild, 2003) and females reaching 23 to 32 mm (Guyer, 2005; Savage, 2002). This frog has a relatively flattened body, broad head, round snout, and forward-directed eyes. It has pale green skin with yellow or yellowish green spots and a white, partly transparent belly showing tiny white bones (Wild, 2003).  The heart and anterior half of the liver are obscured by a white sheet of guanine.  This layer of guanine also wraps around its digestive system (Guyer, 2005).  Fingertips are yellow (Wild, 2003). The eye has a gold-colored iris surrounding a horizontally elliptical pupil (Leenders, 2001).  

Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni is very similar in size and color to the Yellow-flecked Glassfrog (Cochranella albomaculata) and the Powdered Glassfrog (Hyalinobatrachium pulveratum).  However, the latter two species have exposed digestive organs which are not wrapped in a white guanine sheath (Guyer, 2005). 
 
      

","
This frog ranges from Guerrero and Veracruz, Mexico, through Central America to Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, and Surinam (Wild, 2003). It is arboreal and inhabits vegetation near moderate to fast flowing stream at lower elevation (Wild, 2003), sometimes in pastures and cleared sites (Savage, 2002).
","

","
Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni is probably the most abundant glass frog in Costa Rica. It is not threatened (Leenders, 2001).

The evolutionary transition to terrestriality and terrestrial breeding in amphibians has occurred repeatedly, but have the required key adaptations, e.g., resistance to desiccation and toxic ammonia build-up, likewise been repeated? MÃ©ndez-NarvÃ¡ez and Warkentin (2022) examined this question in a comparative study of four frog lineages, contrasting either short (Agalychnis callidryas, Engystomops pustulosus) or long (Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni, Leptodactylus fragilis) larval exposure to desiccating conditions. They carried out experiments in an open lab in the rainforests of Gamboa, Panama (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution). By manipulating environmental conditions (wet vs. dry) and tracking levels of ammonia and urea excretion, they evaluated the tolerance to ammonia exhibited by larvae of each species. They found the two species (H. fleischmanni, L. fragilis) which experience the highest risk of desiccation showed clear evidence for urea production and for pronounced increases in urea excretion, whereas the other two did not. Without urea excretion, the larvae of the high-risk species could experience lethal conditions, providing a clear case for the adaptive value of urea production in these species. They also compared the two foam-nesting species (E. pustulosus, L. fragilis) and two leaf-breeding species (H. fleischmanni, A. callidryas), demonstrating the similar changes in nitrogen metabolism in response to desiccation risk in both comparisons. Their study provides important evidence for the potentially key role of adaptive plasticity in mediating major evolutionary changes. (Written by Kyle Summers)

One of the most remarkable forms of camouflage observed in nature involves transparency in glass frogs of the family Centrolenidae. These frogs, which are arboreal and typically perch on leaves, have highly transparent ventral skin through which their organs can be clearly seen, as well as green dorsal coloration and green bones that presumably enhance their camouflage. One feature that might disrupt their camouflage is the presence of red blood cells, which are easily seen through the transparent ventral skin. Recently Taboada et al. (2022) showed that the glass frog species Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni increase their transparency while resting by two to three-fold by removing about 89% of their red blood cells from circulation and packing them within their liver. This exciting new discovery not only provides new information on the nature of transparency in glass frogs but may also inform biomedical research because the ability to densely pack red blood cells into the liver without clotting could have important human health consequences.

Males reach 24-26 mm SVL, females 25-27 mm SVL (Kubicki 2006). This species is canary-yellow with green reticulations, giving the appearance of yellow spots (smaller on the head and neck) on a green background (Kubicki 2006). It can be distinguished by having a green mid-dorsal line but no yellow paravertebral stripes (Kubicki 2006), a rounded snout in profile with protruding nostril swellings (Savage 2002), an indistinct tympanum (Savage 2002), and a visible red heart (Kubicki 2006).

The head is broad with a snout that is rounded in profile and weakly pointed in dorsal view, protuberant nostrils, and a tympanum that is indistinct (Savage 2002). The pupil is elliptical (Kubicki 2006). Finger I is longer than finger II and fingers have truncated discs (Savage 2002). Webbing is vestigial between finger I and II but varies between specimens as to the other fingers, with extensive webbing between Fingers III-V in some specimens (Kubicki 2006). Toes are rounded, with extensive webbing (Savage 2002). Males do not have nuptial pads (Savage 2002). The inner metatarsal tubercle is small, round, and flattened, while the outer metatarsal tubercle and tarsal fold are lacking (Savage 2002). Bones are yellowish white (Kubicki 2006). It has a colorless pericardial sac, leaving the red heart visible, but the liver and other digestive organs have a white visceral covering (Kubicki 2006). The skin surface is shagreened dorsally and is green with moderate-size yellow spots (Savage 2002).  The venter is transparent, while the ventral surfaces of limbs are flesh-colored (Savage 2002). The iris is gold with small black dots (Kubicki 2006).

Hyalinobatrachium talamancae is similar to H. fleischmanii but can be distinguished by the rounded snout in profile (vs. truncated in H. fleischmanii), protuberant nares (vs. no narial swellings in H. fleishmanii), and an indistinct tympanum (vs. a hidden tympanum in H. fleishmanii) (Savage 2002).  It is also similar to H. vireovittatum but differs from that species by lacking paired yellow paravertebral stripes (vs. yellow paravertebral stripes present on either side of the green mid-dorsal line in H. vireovittatum) (Kubicki 2006). 
","
The type locality is Moravia de ChirripÃ³, Cartago Province, Costa Rica at 1,116 meters a.s.l. (Taylor 1952). However, repeated searches have failed to find additional specimens at the type locality, as the locality has been converted to cattle farming (Kubicki 2006). Other localities include Fila AsunciÃ³n, LimÃ³n Province at 475 meters a.s.l.; Quebrada Talamancae, LimÃ³n Province, at 515 meters a.s.l.; the foothills above the town of AlegrÃ­a on the Atlantic side of the Turrialba Volcano at 850 meters a.s.l.; and Quebrada Ilex, LimÃ³n Province, at 500 meters a.s.l. (Kubicki 2006). All sites have been classified as Tropical Premontane Rain Forest, excluding Fila AsunciÃ³n, LimÃ³n Province, which is Tropical Wet Forest (Holdridge 1967). All sites have high to medium-gradient streams surrounded by an abundance of smooth-leaved plants (Kubicki 2006).


","
Breeding takes place along seepages as well as smaller to medium-sized high gradient streams. The call is a long, low whistle with no obvious rise in pitch at the end, lasting approximately 0.3 seconds. The initial frequency is 4.3 kHz, rising to 4.9 kHz and then falling to 4.6 kHz. Males typically call from the undersides (but sometimes the upper surfaces) of smooth leaves overhanging 2-5 meters above streams, as often as every 10 seconds. Amplexus has been observed to take place usually within the first few hours of darkness. Males are commonly seen at night (and sometimes during the day) guarding a clutch of 20-30 eggs, which are amassed towards the center undersides of leaves. The clutch is laid in a single layer surrounded by a clear jelly substance. Eggs are initially a greenish-white and then change to pinkish-tan as they develop. They hatch after 15 days and larvae then fall into the stream to continue development (Kubicki 2006).

Hyalinobatrachium valerioi is a small frog, with adult males ranging from 19.5 to 24.0 mm, and adult females measuring from 22.5 to 26 mm (Savage 2002).  It has large yellow round spots and small black dots on a green background, so that it mimics the appearance of an egg clutch  (Leenders 2001).  The upper surface is shagreened (with small, rounded bumps).  As with other glass frogs, the venter is transparent; the heart is visible and red, but the digestive tract, pericardium, and liver are wrapped in a white guanine coat.  This frog has a broad head and a snout that appears truncated both in profile and from above.  The eyes have gold irises and are not protuberant.  The tympanum is not distinct.  Digital discs are present and truncate.  The first finger is longer than the second, with webbing present between the outer fingers.  Toes are extensively webbed.  Males have a white nuptial pad consisting of a few separate glands on the outer margin of the thumb base  (Savage 2002; Leenders 2001). 
","
Hyalinobatrachium valerioi can be found from central Costa Rica to the Pacific slopes of Ecuador (Wild 2003).  This frog occurs in lowland moist and wet forest as well as premontane wet forest and rainforest  (Savage 2002). It inhabits vegetation along small, free-flowing streams (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).
","
The Reticulated Glass Frog is nocturnal (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  Males are highly territorial and call from under leaves, throughout the wet season (May to late October) (Savage 2002).  The call consists of a single short ""sheet"" that is repeated after a pause  (Wild 2003).  Territoriality spacing is also maintained by calls (Savage 2002). If another male enters the territory, a call consisting of a squeak is made, sometimes by both the defending and the intruding male (Savage 2002).  If the intruder fails to leave immediately, wrestling occurs and the defending resident male will pin the intruding male down (Savage 2002).  

After mating, the female lays eggs in a sticky jelly mass consisting of a single layer of about 35 eggs, on the underside of a leaf above a stream. The egg deposition site may be up to 6 m above the water.  Eggs are green, and measure about 2 mm in diameter, or 3-4 mm including their envelopes.  The female leaves the breeding site soon after the eggs are fertilized.  After fertilization, the male guards the eggs both at night and during the day.  Other males that approach the eggs are aggressively attacked. Males continue to call, attracting more females, and have been observed to guard up to as many as seven clutches on the underside of a single leaf.  During the day the guarding posture consists of facing the eggs while keeping one hand on the clutch. During nighttime, the male remains in close proximity to the eggs but adopts the guarding posture only sometimes.  At night, in addition to remaining near the eggs, the male parent engages in hydric brooding.  This involves wetting the eggs by settling the posterior ventral side of the body and thighs on top of the clutch and emptying the bladder  
(Savage 2002). 

The male frog parent's diurnal guarding behavior may also serve to protect the clutch from predation by wasps, which have been observed to carry individual eggs and embryos away (McDiarmid 1978).  McDiarmid (1978) hypothesized that the adult mimicry of the coloration of an egg mass might decoy a wasp to approach the guarding male parent rather than the actual clutch.  This might result in the male parent's being able to drive off or consume the potential wasp predator (McDiarmid 1978).       
 
 

","
The tadpole of the Reticulated Glass Frog is small, measuring 12 mm in total length at the time of hatching.  As described by Savage (2002), the tadpole of this species has brown blotches dorsally and on the tail, with the fins being clear and the underside bright red. It has an elongated body and tail, with the body being relatively depressed.  The tail fin is small and the tail tip is rounded.  The spiracle is posterior and midlateral.  The oral disc is complete, with beaks and 2/3 rows of denticles present.  Fine serrations are present on the lower beak.  The A2 row of denticles has a gap above the mouth.  A single row of papillae is present on the lateral and ventral margins of the oral disc.  
","
This species is not threatened but is also not commonly seen (Savage 2002).  The Costa Rican populations appear to be stable; however, it is thought to be in decline in Panama and has disjunct distributions in Panama, Ecuador, and Colombia. It can be found in the Reserva EcolÃ³gica Los Illinizas in Ecuador and in other protected areas in Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica (Solis et al. 2008).
","

","
The color pattern of this frog mimics the egg mass that it guards (McDiarmid 1978). This species is likely to be part of a species complex in Ecuador (Solis et al. 2008).

Many types of predators assault frogs; an unusual group of micropredators are frog-biting midges (Diptera: Corethrellidae). These tiny flies home in on calling frogs from which they get a blood-meal. Although corethrellids have been studied in the context of their predation on single species, the broader interactions among predators and prey have not generally been examined. For example, does a midge species attack only a single frog species, and how many midge species are in a community? Virgo et al. (2021) examined a midge-frog community of 17 frog species in Costa Rica and found that although a single midge species may attack a variety of frog species, there is some degree of specialization, and certain frog species were targeted much more frequently. Although five different morphospecies of corethrellids were identified, DNA analysis detected several, up to 20, cryptic species. When the DNA-delimited candidate species were used as units instead of the morphospecies, the specificity of the mite-frog interactions increased. Much remains to be investigated in this fascinating system, such as whether there has been co-evolution of the flies and their prey, or what exactly attracts certain fly species to frog species.

(Savage 2002). The pericardium is covered by a guanine sheath  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  The bones are green, and are visible when viewed from the dorsal side 
 (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).   
The head is as wide as it is long, and rounded when viewed dorsally  
(Savage 2002).  The snout is rounded in profile  
(Savage 2002). Eyes are large, with gray-gold irises and black reticula, and the pupils are horizontal

Sachatamia ilex is a medium-sized frog, reaching up to 37 mm in length (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  It is commonly known as either the Ghost Glass Frog or the Limon Giant Glass Frog.   Sachatamia ilex can be up to twice the size of related species, making it the largest species of glass frog in Central America. This frog also has prominent, protuberant nostrils located on a slightly elevated ridge on its head. The eyes are positioned on top of the large semicircular head so that the eyes point directly forward. The pupils are horizontally elliptical (Leenders 2001). The tympanum is round and indistinct. Vomerine teeth are present in transverse rows between the choanae and are medially separated.  The toes are extensively webbed, in contrast to the fingers, where more extensive webbing is present only between the outer fingers (III-V).  Finger and toe discs are present and truncate.  Males have a nuptial pad on the dorsal and outer lateral surfaces at the base of the thumb (Savage 2002), and a humeral spine embedded within the arm musculature (i.e. non-protruding) and running approximately parallel to the humerus (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007).

 Sachatamia ilex has a deep leaf green body, with a light green or white throat and belly, and a distinct white lip stripe (Leenders 2001; Savage 2002).  Occasionally, scattered white dots are present on the dorsum. This frog also has yellowish hands and feet (Leenders 2001).  The bones are dark green, a characteristic shared with other centrolenid frogs and one genus of hylid frogs, Trachycephalus (treated under the name Phrynohyas in Savage 2002).  Sachatamia ilex has a white, parietal peritoneal sheath covering its internal organs (Leenders 2001).  The digestive tract itself is unpigmented  (Savage 2002). The eyes are silver with black reticulations, and are positioned on top of the large semicircular head so that the eyes point directly forward (Leenders 2001). Nuptial pads are white (Savage 2002). 
","
Sachatamia ilex occurs in Colombia, Nicaragua, Panama, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. It is found mainly in the foothills of the Central and Talamanca Mountain ranges, as well as in a few locations on the northern Pacific slopes, at elevations up to 1420 m above sea level (Stuart et al. 2008). Within Ecuador it has been reported from the northern Pacific lowlands in the provinces of Esmeraldas and Pichincha, at 180-800 m in elevation (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007). It inhabits primary and secondary wet forests, and is found on large low-lying leaves, often in the spray zone of waterfalls or streams (Stuart et al. 2008; Leenders 2001).
","
The Ghost Glass Frog is nocturnal and arboreal, and is not common.  During the daytime it sleeps on the top surface of exposed leaves (Leenders 2001). 

It is able to vary the intensity of its green coloration to match the substrate on which it is resting (Leenders 2001). 

Males call from the upper side of leaves, usually with the head facing the tip of the leaf (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007). The call consists of a single high-pitched ""click"", repeated after intervals of several minutes (Savage 2002). 

Females deposit black eggs on upper leaf surfaces overhanging a stream (Savage 2002).

Teratohyla midas is a small frog, with males having a snout-to-vent length of 17.4 - 19.2mm, and females having a snout-to-vent length of 20.6 - 25.6mm. The head is wider than the body, with a snout that appears shortened when viewed from the back and the sides. There is a rounded ridge that runs from the edge of the eye to the nostril, and the region between the eye and the nostril is curved outwards. The nostrils, which protrude towards the sides of the back, are located at the edge of the snout furthest from the center of the body, and the region the nostrils is slightly convex. The lips are rounded, and the eyes are fairly big and are faced towards the front and sides. The upper third of the tympanum is not visible, with the rest of the tympanum facing the sides of the back. There are no tubercles, and males lack humeral spines. Finger I is longer than Finger II, Finger III is longer than Finger IV, but no information is available on the relative lengths of all the fingers. There is primitive webbing between Fingers I and II. The discs on the fingers are shortened. The subarticular tubercles are tiny and round, the palmar tubercle is big, and there are no supernumerary tubercles. The legs are fairly thin. The legs have small subarticular tubercles, lengthened inner metatarsal tubercles, and no outer metatarsal or supernumerary tubercles. Two thirds of the foot is webbed, and there is no information available on the relative toe lengths. The toe discs are more rounded than the finger discs. The skin on the back is rough, and the skin on the underside is grainy. The rest of the body is smooth. The cloaca is located at the upper region of the thighs, with two large tubercles right beneath it (Lynch and Duellman 1973).

Teratohyla midas looks similar to Rulyrana flavopunctata, but it is differentiated from R. flavopunctata by a truncate instead of rounded snout, and by having less webbing on its hands and feet. It also looks similar to Nymphargus siren, but it is differentiated from N. siren by having a less prominent tympanum that points towards the sides and the back instead of towards the sides and the posterior, and it has more webbing on its hands and feet (Lynch and Duellman 1973).

In life, the entire backside is dark green with some gold fleck colorations on its sides, and has a white chest. The lining of the abdominal cavity is unpigmented, and it has green bones. The iris is silvery bronze with a black-netted pattern, and the hands and feet are a pale yellow-green color. In preservative, its entire backside is lavender with some white fleck colorations on its body. The rest of its body is creamy white (Lynch and Duellman 1973).

There is no information available on variation within the species.
","
Teratohyla midas is found in Brazil, Ecuador, French Guiana, and Peru. It may also be found in southern Colombia, but there are no records to verify this. It is found in elevation from 200m - 360m. This species lives in lightly modified tropical forests and is often found on leaves and branches (Rodriguez et al. 2012).

Teratohyla midas deposits its eggs on leaves above bodies of water, typically streams, where the tadpoles will be able to develop after hatching. As with most other Teratohyla species, Teratohyla midas only deposits its egg clutches on the upper sides of leaves (Cisneros-Heredia et al. 2009, Rodriguez et al. 2012).
","

","
Teratohyla midas has a stable population trend. It is listed as a least concern amphibian because of its tolerance to habitat modification, and wide distribution. This species has large areas of habitat remaining although some habitat loss has occurred due to logging, agriculture, colonization, and the collection of wood. It is found in the Manu Reserve Zone in Peru as well as in conservation units and reserves in Brazil and Ecuador (Rodriguez et al. 2012).
","
Teratohyla midas has been found in areas of human activity and disturbance (Rodriguez et al. 2012).
","
Mitochondrial analyses suggest that Teratohyla is sister to Rulyrana, whereas nuclear analyses suggest that Teratohyla is sister to a clade formed by Chimerella, Espadarana, Cochranella, Rulyrana, and Sachatamia (Guayasamin et al. 2009).

The species name midas refers to a king in Greek mythology, who turned everything he touched into gold. This is a reference to the frog being found in Rio Aguarico, where gold has been found, and also a reference to the gold fleck coloration found on the frog (Lynch and Duellman 1973).

Diagnosis: Small lime-green frog with yellow spots (apple-green dorsum with white spots in Honduran specimens; McCranie and Wilson 2002) and an obtuse snout in profile, light green bones, translucent parietal peritoneum, and white pericardium, liver, and digestive tract (Savage 2002). 

Can be distinguished from all other Honduran centrolenids except Hyalinobatrachium chirripoi by extensive webbing between Fingers II-III.  T. pulverata differs from H. chirripoi by having vomerine teeth, pale green bones, a white parietal pericardium, an obtuse snout, and an unpigmented Type I nuptial pad in males (McCranie and Wilson 2002, comparing to H. cardiacalyptum, which has been synonymized with H. chirripoi).

Description: This uncommon, small frog has a snout-vent length of 22 mm to 29 mm in males and 23 mm to 29 mm in females.  The top of the head is flat. The snout is moderately elongated, appearing rounded from the dorsal view and obtuse in lateral profile.  The canthus rostralis is distinct and rounded, while the loreal region is slightly concave. Nostrils are slightly swollen and directed anterolaterally, situated closer to the margin of the snout than to the eyes, and the internarial area is slightly concave. Eyes are protuberant and visible past the lip margin from overhead, with horizontally elliptical pupils.  The tongue is ovoid and slightly free posteriorly.  Vomerine teeth are in patches on elevated, medial, inclined ridges and separated from neighboring tooth patches by a distance shorter than the width of the patches.  Maxillary teeth are also present.  The tympanum can appear either distinct or indistinct; a supratympanic fold narrowly obscures the upper edge of the tympanum.  The body shape is angular and slightly flat.  Upper arms are slender and forearms are moderately robust.  A low dermal ridge is present along the posterior ventrolateral margin of the forearm.  Discs on fingers are moderately expanded, and the disc pads on the hands and fingers are truncate.  Fingers have round, globular to slightly raised subarticular tubercles.  The palmar tubercle is elevated and ovoid.  The prepollex lacks a free distal end, and the prepollical spine is absent.  Finger lengths relative to each other are II < I < IV < III.  Fingers I and II have basal webbing, and the remaining fingers are characterized by webbing pattern II 1-3 III 1 3/4-1 IV.  Fingers II-IV have weak lateral keels on the unwebbed portions.  Heels overlap broadly when adpressed.  The inner tarsal fold is weak and extends about one-third the length of the tarsus.  Toes have round subarticular tubercles.  The inner metatarsal tubercle is elevated and elliptical while the outer metatarsal tubercle is either absent or indistinct.  Toe lengths relative to each other are I < II < III = V < IV, with expanded, truncated toe discs that are slightly smaller than those on the fingers.  Webbing on the feet is characterized by I 1-2 II 3/4-2 III 3/4-2 IV 2-3/4 V.  Lateral keels are present on unwebbed portions of the toes.  The dorsal skin is weakly granular and the most obvious granules are present on the snout and sides of the head.  The throat, belly and ventral surfaces of the thighs are characterized by coarsely areolate skin. Below the vent, granules range in size from small to large with subcloacal folds positioned laterally to the granules. Males possess paired vocal slits, a medium-sized sub-gular sac, and unpigmented nuptial pads (Savage 2002; McCranie and Wilson 2002). 

In life, female specimens have ""apple green"" (McCranie and Wilson 2002) dorsal surfaces with numerous indistinct white spots.  The skin of the lower portion of the flanks is yellowish-white while the skin on the belly and chest is translucent. Eyes have translucent and unpatterned palpebral membranes.  The bones of this species are pale green.  The parietal pericardium and the visceral peritoneum are white while the parietal peritoneum is translucent (Savage 2002).  

In preservative, the dorsal surfaces of the frog take on a yellowish-white tinge with many tiny lavender flecks.  The flecking is absent where white spots were present when the frog was alive.  The anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are pale yellow, while the skin of the chest and belly are translucent and colorless.  The parietal pericardium and visceral peritoneum remain white, and the parietal peritoneum remains colorless in preservative (the same as in life).  
","
Distribution on the Atlantic versant ranges from north-central Honduras to Valle de Cauca, Colombia and on the Pacific versant from southern Costa Rica to southeastern Panama (Savage 2002; McCranie and Wilson 2002).  Within Honduras this species is known from northwestern and eastern Olancho and from a single locality in southeastern Colon (McCranie and Wilson 2002).  Teratohyla pulverata lives in moist lowland and wet forest habitats at low to moderate elevations, up to 960 m asl (Savage 2002). 
","
During the rainy season from May to October, males call from the vegetation surrounding fast-moving streams, similar to other Costa Rican centrolenids (Savage 2002).  Eggs are deposited on leaves above water (SolÃ­s et al. 2008). Ovarian eggs found within a collected female specimen were greenish-tinged (McCranie and Wilson 2002).  A single clutch of unguarded embryos was observed to exit their egg capsules with exposure to formalin; these embryos had pale brown bodies and tail musculature in life, along with greenish-yellow yolk sacs (McCranie and Wilson 2002).  
","

","
It is somewhat common in Honduras, not common in Costa Rica, and rare in Colombia.  Its population status in Nicaragua and Panama has not been reported. It occurs within several protected areas.  Although populations may face local threats from deforestation and pollution, overall the species is not threatened.  It can apparently tolerate some habitat fragmentation as it is known to persist in small patches of suitable habitat (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).
","

","
The name  pulveratum  stems from the Latin word  pulveris  meaning ""dust"" or ""powder"" and the Latin suffix  -atus , meaning ""provided with""; it alludes to the tiny spots on the dorsal surfaces of preserved specimens (McCranie and Wilson 2002).

Diagnosis: Small uniformly green frog that can be distinguished by a free prepollex at the base of the thumb with an exposed spine in adult males, a round to truncate snout in profile, dark green bones, and only the parietal peritoneal sheath and heart white (Savage 2002).

Description: This rarely seen small frog has a snout vent length ranging from 17.8 mm to 20 mm in adult males and 20 mm to 23 mm in adult females.  The head is as wide as long and appears truncated in profile and semicircular in outline.  The eyes are large and protuberant, and the interorbital space between is larger than the diameter of the eyes.  The snout has a subovoid outline and appears truncated.  The tympanum is indistinct and is directed obliquely upward.  Vomerine teeth are present in two small patches that are widely separated and immediately medial to the choanae.  The body shape is small and slender.  The dorsal skin is granular in texture.  Finger and toe discs are truncated. Fingers have small subarticular tubercles but no supernumerary tubercles. Accessory palmar and plantar tubercles are present.  Finger I is longer than Finger II; vestigial webbing is present between these two fingers.  More substantial webbing exists between the outer fingers in the pattern II 2-3 III 2 - 1 3/4 IV.  Toes are moderately webbed, described as I 1-2 II 1-2 III 1-2 IV 2-1 V.  An elongated inner metatarsal tubercle is present, but the outer metatarsal tubercle is lacking. No inner tarsal fold. Males possess a white nuptial pad on the lateral margin and dorsal of the thumb base.  Frogs of this species possess a free prepollex. In larger males the prepollical spine projects externally (Savage 2002).  

 The coloration is uniformly green on the dorsum, with white pigmentation on the undersides of limbs.  The iris is gray-ivory with a black reticulum.  This species has dark green bones and a white heart (Savage 2002).  
","
Honduras (McCranie and Wilson 2002; McCranie 2007), Nicaragua (Sunyer and KÃ¶hler 2007; Sunyer et al. 2009), Costa Rica (Savage 2002; Kubicki 2007), Panama (Savage 2002), Colombia (Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996), Ecuador (Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2005; Cisneros-Heredia and McDiarmid 2007; Cisneros-Heredia 2009).  Teratohyla spinosa  is distributed in the humid Atlantic lowlands and wet forests ranging from Costa Rica to eastern Panama and south along the Pacific versant to western Ecuador (Savage 2002).  It has been found at up to 650 m asl in Costa Rica and 800 m asl in Panama (Coloma et al. 2008).
","
Throughout the wet season lasting from May to October, males call from the low vegetation surrounding small streams (Savage 2002). The voice of  Teratohyla spinosa  is similar to that of  Cochranella euknemos  and  Cochranella granulosa : a harsh series of repeating ""creep, creeps"" with considerable pauses in between (Savage 2002).  The dominant frequency is 6.8 to 7.2 kHz (IbaÃ±ez et al. 1999).  
 Teratohyla spinosa  females lay 18-25 green eggs on the underside of vegetation in a single layer of loose jelly.  The eggs and capsules together are 5 to 7 mm in diameter.  While embryos appear gray upon hatching, they develop light brown upper-sides and paler under-sides in later stages.  Juvenile frogs are 16 mm in standard length when first metamorphosed (Savage 2002).   
","

","
This species is common in Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, and there are a number of recent reports from Nicaragua.  It is not common in either Honduras or Ecuador. The population trend appears to be decreasing. Major threats include habitat loss due to deforestation for agriculture, logging, and human settlement, and pollution from spraying illegal crops.  It is found in a number of protected areas, although not in Ecuador (Coloma et al. 2008).

","
Ceratophrys cranwelli is a large, robust frog. Adult snoutâ€“vent length varies widely from 42 to 130 mm (Valetti et al. 2012; Schalk and Fitzgerald 2015). Snout-vent length of metamorphs is between 25 and 43 mm (Schalk and Fitzgerald 2015). This species has a large, flat, wide head with prominent eyes and lenticular pupils. It has characteristic triangular ""horned"" ridges above the eyes (Barrio 1980; Valetti et al. 2012). The jaw articulation occurs at the the craniovertebral joint level (Fabrezi 2011), which gives this species an unusually large gape that is more than half as wide as the snout-vent length (Schalk and Fitzgerald 2015). This species also has nonâ€“pedicellate teeth with a broad base curved into sharp pointsâ€”an unusual dentition among frogs (Lappin et al. 2017). Fingers are short and nonâ€“webbed; toes are slightly webbed (Barrio 1980).

In life, C. cranwelli is light brown to muted green with dark brown dorsal spots and a pale underbelly (Barrio 1980; Valetti et al. 2012). The pattern of the spots gives the frog a tridentâ€“like pattern on its dorsal aspect (Barrio 1980). There are dark brown bands covering the forelimbs transversely (Valetti et al. 2012). 

Ceratophys cranwelli was once considered the same species as C. ornata, but they can now be distinguished by several features. Ceratophrys cranwelli is diploid (2n = 26), whereas C. ornata is octoploid (8n = 104). Ceratophrys cranwelli can also be distinguished from C. ornata by the triangular ridges above the eyes of C. cranwelli, which are not prominent in C. ornata (Barrio 1980; Valetti et al. 2012). The two species also have different cranial proportions. Ceratophrys cranwelli is known to have more muted colors, whereas C. ornata is more brightly colored and may contain some reds; C. cranwelli may also have a trident pattern on the dorsal aspect, which is absent in C. ornata (Barrio 1980). The two species occupy separate geographic regions: C. ornata occupies parts of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, while C. cranwelli is found in more northern regions (Brusquetti and Lavilla 2006). However, along the border of these speciesâ€™ ranges, individuals of either species may not be as readily distinguishedâ€”in these cases, only a karyotype will definitively identify the species (Barrio 1980).


","
This species is found in the Gran Chaco, which is an ecoregion spanning Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. The frogs live within and around ephemeral ponds but were not observed in a semipermanent pond or far from ponds (Reichle et al. 2004, Schalk and Fitzgerald 2015). They may be found at altitudes as high as 700 m asl (Reichle et al. 2004).
","
This species is normally fossorial, although they become more active and terrestrial during the rainy season (Faivovich et al. 2014). They are found in and around ephemeral ponds (Schalk and Fitzgerald 2015). 

The adults are sitâ€“andâ€“wait predators; their diet consists of an array of vertebrates, including other anurans, accommodated by C. cranwelliâ€™s large gape (Schalk et al. 2014) and strong bite force (Lappin et al. 2017).

They breed during the early rainy season (Valetti et al. 2012). Females are oviparous and lay eggs in ponds, which hatch into tadpoles (Fabrezi 2011); the clutch size in one study was 1200 eggs (Salgado Costa et al. 2014). 

Ceratophrys cranwelli possesses the ability to produce sounds even as tadpoles. In one study, tadpoles between Gosner stages 25 and 42 emitted underwater sounds when interacting with conspecifics. In an environment with a low predator:prey ratio, in which there was relatively more heterospecific prey, there were fewer instances of cannibalism than when there was a high predator:prey ratio. This supports the idea that underwater sound emissions play some role in predator avoidance within the species, but they are less successful when heterospecific prey is scarce (Salgado Costa et al. 2014).

Adult males of this species call. The call consists of a series of vocalizations that begin at a low intensity before peaking in the middle and falling back down; it has been described as sounding like a bass horn. The call has a dominant frequency range of 1,400 â€“ 1900 Hz, a pulse rate of around 0.192 pulses/ms, and a call duration of roughly 319 â€“ 358 ms (Salas et al. 1998; Valetti et al. 2012). Pulse rate and call duration are dependent on temperature, with pulse rates increasing and call duration decreasing with increasing temperature. Males typically call throughout the night while partially submerged in ponds (Valetti et al. 2012).

","
Tadpoles at Gosner developmental stages 39 â€“ 42 generally have an snout-vent length of about 25 â€“ 31 mm and a total length of roughly 57 â€“ 68 mm (Fabrezi 2011). Mouthparts have very keratinized jaw sheaths, which are well-adapted for tearing prey items (Vera Candioti 2005).

The tadpoles are carnivorous and are known to eat other tadpoles (including those within their own species), insects, and crustaceans, among other animals (Vera Candioti 2004). 
","
When this species was last assessed by IUCN in 2004, the population trend was found to be decreasing; however, the species was listed as â€œLeast Concernâ€ because of its wide distribution. Factors that may be contributing to this include persecution by people within their range who believe the frogs to be venomous; collection for sale in the pet trade; and collection of eggs for research (Reichle et al. 2004). Eight percent of C. cranwelliâ€™s range lies within protected areas (Nori et al. 2016). 
","
Ceratophrys cranwelli is commonly sold in the pet trade as Pacâ€“Man frogs. Within their range, they are collected for the pet trade and sometimes intentionally killed due to the misbelief that they are venomous; eggs are collected for sale within the scientific research community (Reichle et al. 2004).
","
Recent molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that C. cranwelli is the sister taxon of C. ornata. The genes included in this study were cytochrome oxidase I, cytochrome b, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, tRNAVal, tRNALeu, tRNAIle and an additional section of 16S, as well as homolog 1, rhodopsin, tyrosinase, recombinationâ€“activating gene 1, proopiomelanocortin A gene and chemokine receptor 4 and analyzed by parsimony analysis (Faivovich et al. 2014).

The genus name, â€œCeratophrysâ€, is derived from the Greek word for â€œhornâ€, ÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Ï„Î¿, in reference to the hornâ€“like protrusions above the eye in adults (Barrio 1980). 

The specific name, â€œcranwelliâ€, is in honor of Dr. Jorge Cranwell, who was the first person to observe and identify C. cranwelli as a species separate from C. ornata (Barrio 1980). Cranwell managed the herpetology collection of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and wrote the field guide Para la herpetologÃ­a de Misiones (Beolens et al. 2013).

Lepidobatrachus laevis is a large, stout, aquatic frog with a dorsoventrally flattened body.  Females of this species may reach a total body length (SVL) of 100 mm, while a sexually mature male may be only half as large.  In both sexes the head is large and robust, composing approximately 1/3 of the total body length, and broad to make room for the extraordinarily wide jaws of these animals.  There are large teeth on the upper jaw and two large medially placed teeth or fangs on the lower jaw.  The nostrils and eyes are dorsally positioned, the pupils are rhomboidal and the tympanum is distinct.  The forelimbs and hind limbs are short, and the forelimbs are held forward while swimming.  The digits of the forelimbs are unwebbed, but the digits of the hind limb are fully webbed and a large, spade-like, black inner metatarsal tubercle is present.  The skin is mostly smooth except for the raised dorsal glandulae of the lateral line, which are distinct and from a â€œVâ€ that narrows posteriorly.  The dorsal coloration of L. laevis is dark green to gray with darker blotches outlined in orange that becomes more visible laterally.  The nostrils and eyes may be outlined by lighter green, perhaps providing camouflage.  The ventral surface is white or cream colored and unmarked.  Sexually mature males possess a dark blue-black throat (Budgett 1899; Cei 1980).




","
L. laevis occur in the Gran Chaco of South America, a semiarid region extending into northern Argentina, southern Paraguay, and much of Bolivia.  In Argentina this species can be found in the provinces of Chaco, Cordoba, Corrientes, Salta, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero (Faivovich 1994). Within Paraguay it is found in the departments of Alto Paraguay, BoquerÃ³n, and Presidente Hayes in Paraguay (Faivovich 1994).  In Bolivia it occurs within the departments of Santa Cruz and Tarija (Aquino et al. 2004).  Its altitudinal range is from 0-200 m asl (Aquino et al. 2004).
  
Within the chaco, L. laevis is found in ephemeral pools (pozos) that form during the summer rains from October to February.  During the wet summer months these frogs feed and breed in the pozos.  As the pools dry up at the end of summer the animals burrow into the soft mud using the large tubercles on their hind limbs.  They remain inactive underground during the dry winter months.




","
L. laevis displays a suite of interesting adaptations to the semiarid environment of the Gran Chaco.  The rhythm of activity of the adults of this species is synchronized with the extreme climate of this region of South America.  During the dry winter months L. laevis remains inactive underground, encased in a hard shell composed of layers of unshed skin.  This â€œcocoonâ€ protects the animal from excessive water loss and allows it to persist until the rains arrive that signal the beginning of the wet summer months, which typically last from October to February.  The heavy spring or summer rains flood the chaco and create many temporary pools or â€œpozosâ€ which provide suitable habitat for L. laevis.

Once the pools form L. laevis emerge from their cocoons to feed and breed.  These frogs appear to be nocturnal sit-and-wait ambush predators.  They remain motionless while submerged in the water or soft mud with only their eyes and nostrils visible.  There they wait among grasses and reeds for prey to come within grasp of their strong, powerful jaws.  The large size of these frogs and the size of their jaws imply that they feed on large prey, most likely other anurans, large insects and snails.  In general these are very aggressive frogs.  When disturbed, they inflate themselves and stand on their outstretched limbs to appear larger.  If this fails to deter a potential predator, they begin to lunge, bite, and then emit a piercing shriek.  This behavior is quite impressive and provides the name for this species in Guarani - kukurÃº-chinÃ­ or â€œthe toad that shrieksâ€ (Vellard 1948).

The reproductive biology and larval ecology of L. laevis provide additional examples of the fascinating biology of this particular species of frog.  A single breeding event may result in as many as 1400 fertile eggs.  The embryos develop very rapidly, a characteristic of many desert anurans that often are in a race against time to metamorphose into adults before their breeding pool dries up.  When the tadpoles hatch and begin feeding, however, their uniqueness becomes even more apparent.  The tadpoles are carnivorous and cannibalistic and begin feeding almost immediately.  Although carnivory and cannibalism are relatively rare among larval anurans, it is the morphology of the jaws of L. laevis tadpoles which sets them apart.  Unlike other carnivorous anuran larvae, L. laevis possess nearly adult-like jaws.  The cartilages that support the larval jaws are expanded laterally to create a wide, gaping mouth which the tadpoles of this species use to ingest their prey whole.  Ruibal and Thomas (1988) illustrate this feeding apparatus in detail and coin the term â€œmegalophagyâ€ to describe the unique larval feeding ecology.




","

","
This species is thought to be more common in Bolivia (the northern portion of its range) and rare in Argentina (Aquino et al. 2004). In spite of the many interesting features of the ecology and morphology of L. laevis, this species remains poorly known.  This is perhaps because of their secretive nature, nocturnal habits and long period of inactivity during the dry season.  Also, these frogs do not appear to be particularly abundant where they occur.  These factors, combined with their strict habitat requirements, make L. laevis vulnerable to habitat modification associated with agriculture and ranching where they occur.  This species is also apparently susceptible to chytridiomycosis, with one death reported in a captive specimen (Une et al. 2008).

Conraua goliath is the largest frog in the world, with some individuals weighing as much as 3.3 kilograms and reaching ~32 cm snoutâ€“vent length (KrÃ¼ger 1912; Sabater-Pi 1985. Channing and RÃ¶del 2019). The largest reported individuals are females, with males ranging from 22 â€“ 32 cm snoutâ€“vent length (1.5 â€“ 2.7 kg) and females ranging from 15 â€“ 32 cm snoutâ€“vent length (0.6 â€“ 3.3 kg) (Sabater-Pi 1985). 
 
The species description by Boulenger (1906 - Annals) was based on one specimen. The depressed head is wider than long with an obtusely pointed snout. The nostril is closer to the snout tip than the eye. The canthus rostralis is obtuse and the loreal region is deeply grooved. The interorbital space is shorter than the length of the upper eyelid. The tympanum is small relative to the large head, and bordered above by a prominent fold or ridge. The short fingers each have one large, flat, oval subarticular tubercle. The first and second fingers are about equal and the third is longer than the fourth (Boulenger 1906 - Annals). The hindlimbs are powerful and long relative to the body length (~150% of snoutâ€“vent length; Sabater-Pi 1985). When extended along the body, the tibiotarsal articulation reaches the tip of the snout. The feet are as long as the crus (Boulenger 1906 - Annals) and fully webbed with relatively thick interdigital membranes extending along the full length of the toes and ending at the disc-like toe tips (see photograph in Zahl 1967). The foot has a flat, elliptical inner metatarsal tubercle and no outer tubercle. As with the fingers, the moderate toes have large, flat, oval subarticular tubercles. There is a strong dermal fringe on the outer side of the fifth toe (Boulenger 1906  - Annals).  The skin on the dorsum and on top of the limbs is granular with many fine ridges (Pawley 1987). The flanks have small warts. The upper surface of the thighs and tibias have longitudinal granular folds. The belly and throat also have small granules (Boulenger  1906 - Annals).
 
Conraua goliath can be differentiated from Conraua robusta, the only other large Conraua that co-occurs with C. goliath, via the ventral coloration, which is white or gray in C. robusta (Channing and RÃ¶del 2019). Though some species of Conraua retain lateral line organs as adults, these organs are lost at metamorphosis in C. goliath and C. robusta (as well as the other Central African C. crassipes; Gutsche et al. 2023).
 
In life, the background dorsal coloration ranges from dark green to orangey green with darker spots on the dorsum. There are irregular cross-bars on the limbs and the posterior surface of the hindlimbs are blackish with white spots. The abdomen and ventral part of the limbs are yellowish orange (Boulenger  1906 - Annals; Channing and RÃ¶del 2019). 

","
The distribution of Conraua goliath is limited to a small region of Central Africa in the countries of Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea. In this region, C. goliath occurs in the tropical lowland forests of the Lower Guinean Forest Zone, extending 150 â€“ 200 km  inland and from near sea level to ~700 m (Gonwouo et al. 2022). Its distribution extends from the Sanaga river basin in Cameroon in the north to the Benito river basin in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in the south, and is found in rivers including the Benito, KienkÃ©, LaÃ±a, Nkebe, Ntem, Nyong, Sanaga, and Uoro (Boulenger 1906 - Annals; Perret 1957; Sabater-Pi 1985; Lasso et al. 2002; Herrmann et al. 2005). 
 
Adult goliath frogs are found in rapids and cascades of rivers with a sandy bottom and clean, slightly tannic, cool (16 â€“ 22 oC), oxygen-rich waters (Sabater-Pi 1962, 1985; Zahl 1967). Typically, these rivers are large enough to not be enclosed within the forest canopy (Amiet 1986).
","
While adults of C. goliath are generally nocturnal, during the day adults may bask on rocks emerging from streams and rivers for up to a half hour at a time before returning to the water (Sabater-Pi 1985; Channing and RÃ¶del 2019). The escape behavior of individuals in or near rivers is to jump into the water, typically with a single leap. In some cases, however, individuals have been observed to skitter across the surface of the water with as many as seven consecutive short leaps over as much as 3.5 m (Herrmann and Edwards 2006). On land, however, individuals typically appear exhausted after five or six leaps (Sabater-Pi 1967) making them easy to capture by humans. Once in the water, adults have been observed to bury themselves in the sediment and leaves on the river bottom (Gonwouo et al. 2022).

Large adults are often observed on rocks close to or within waterfalls and rapids spaced at a distance of 3 - 5 m, whereas subadults are found more often on mid-stream rocks. Metamorphs and juveniles in pools adjacent to the river that have more slow-moving water (Gonwouo et al. 2022).
 
In RÃ­o Muni of Equatorial Guinea, reproduction occurs during the dry season (July and August) as well as during the short dry season of December and January (Zahl 1967).
 
Egg masses are deposited underwater and attached to vegetation or stones in pools near rapids (Sabater-Pi 1985; Channing and RÃ¶del 2019). In some cases, frogs (likely males) create nests in existing pools and washouts that may be expanded, whereas in others frogs actively dig depressions into the gravel banks of rivers (SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019). In all cases, these pools and depressions are actively cleaned of leaf litter and detritus by the frogs. Most nests contain 150 â€“ 350 eggs, though in some cases might have as many as 2,800 eggs (SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019). Multiple nests may be deposited in these pools and depressions, with up to three cohorts of tadpoles being involved in some nests, and tadpoles appear to finish development within these nests (SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019). Larval development takes approximately 3 months to go through metamorphosis (Zahl 1967; Sabater-Pi 1985). Female frogs attend these nests for some period of time after oviposition (SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019).
 
Freshwater shrimp have been observed feeding on eggs of C. goliath within the nests constructed by adults (SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019).
 
The diets of adults include insects (beetles, ants, dragonflies, caddisflies), millipedes, freshwater shrimp, spiders, scorpions, freshwater snails, as well as larval and adult anurans (Perret 1957, 1960; Sabater-Pi 1962, 1967, 1985; Gewalt 1977). In captivity, when fed young mice, frogs have been observed to feed out of the water, though will also feed while their bodies are submerged in the water, capturing prey on the waterâ€™s surface (Pawley 1987). Suction-feeding, however, has not been reported in these aquatic frogs.
 
Despite previous assertions that adults do not call (Perret 1957; Sabater-Pi, 1985), C. goliath has a repertoire of call types, including brief whistles, chirping, and even a â€œsighing deep roarâ€ (Channing and RÃ¶del 2019). The advertisement call of Conraua goliath is a high frequency sound of long duration (4.1 kHz, and up to 1.5 minutes; Pawley and Hutchison 1989; Hutchison 1998; Amiet and Goutte 2017). Strangely, claims were made in jest during the early 20th-century that this very large frog might have a high frequency call (Claybird and Wanawiwi 1939), and this appears to be the case. Similar to C. crassipes, the advertisement call of C. goliath is produced with the mouth open (Hutchison 1998).
 
In captivity, males have been observed to exhibit territorial behaviors including lunges at one another, wrestling venter to venter, and biting (Pawley and Hutchison, 1989). These may be sometimes accompanied by vocalizations varying between guttural calls (1.6 â€“ 2.3 kHz) and high-frequency squeaks (4.5 â€“ 5.8 kHz) (Pawley and Hutchison 1989; Hutchison, 1998). These interactions were only observed during the day and ranged from occurring once per week to as rarely as every three or four months.
","
Tadpoles have robust and muscular tails and mouths with prominent, heavily keratinized jaw sheaths, 7 rows of keratodonts surrounding the mouth (keratodont formula: 7(5 â€“ 7)/7(1)), and many small papillae, especially around lateral and ventral borders (Lamotte et al. 1959; Channing et al. 2012). The straight, short spiracular tube is located on the left side of the posterior half of the body. The vent tube is nearly one-third the length of the body and opens on the right side of the ventral fin (Channing et al. 2012). 

In life, the coloration of the body of tadpoles is a somber grey with darker round spots on the dorsal surface, with equally large but more irregular spots on the tail. The spiracular tube is unpigmented (Lamotte et al. 1959; Channing et al. 2012).

Sabater-Pi (1985) reported that tadpoles of C. goliath feed on the leaves of the aquatic plant ""Dicraea warmingii""; the genus Dicraea is currently considered a junior synonym of the genus Podostemum (Podostemaceae), which does not occur in Africa, and the taxon to which Sabater-Pi (1985) is likely referring, Inversodicraea warmingiana, is a high elevation Angolan endemic. Thus, the identity of this aquatic plant remains unknown, though is plausibly a member of the Podostemaceae (M. Cheek, pers. comm. to D.C. Blackburn). 
","
This species has a limited geographic distribution, narrow ecological requirements, is actively hunted by peoples in both Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, and is threatened by the conversion of forests into agricultural lands, logging, water pollution (including by agrochemicals), and potentially hydroelectric dams (Gonwouo et al. 2022). Conraua goliath persists at least at some sites with documented agrochemical contamination (Gonwouo et al. 2022), though what impact this has on their biology is not clear. There are currently ex situ conservation efforts beginning in Cameroon in an attempt to rear this species in captivity (Ruoso 2018).
","
The Goliath frog is hunted frequently for food, including using poisons, nets, traps, and snares, including above oviposition sites (Perret 1957; Sabater-Pi 1985; SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019). Likely due to this hunting pressure, C. goliath is more abundant and attains larger body sizes farther from human settlements (Gonwouo et al. 2022). As of 2019, it remains the only amphibian species afforded special protection status in Cameroon, which is why it is subject to the US Lacey Act even though it is not protected by CITES.

The species authority is: Boulenger, G. A. (1906). â€œDescriptions of new batrachians discovered by Mr. G.L. Bates in South Cameroon.â€ Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Series 7, 17: 317â€“323.
 
A recent phylogenetic study of relationships among species of Conraua (Blackburn et al. 2020) found a strongly supported sister relationship between C. goliath and C. robusta; both are large-bodied species that can occur in syntopy in Cameroon. Recent phylogenomic analysis have recovered Conrauidae, which contains only the genus Conraua, as the sister lineage of the Petropedetidae (Feng et al. 2017; Yuan et al. 2019). Conrauidae and Petropedetidae are, in turn, sister to the Pyxicephalidae.
 
Since their discovery, goliath frogs have proved fascinating to scientists and the public alike (Boulenger 1906 - Proceedings; KrÃ¼ger, 1912), inspiring work both in the field and at zoos and aquaria (Gewalt, 1976, 1977; Pawley, 1987) and many popular articles (Sabater-Pi, 1962, 1967, 1972; Zahl, 1967; Ruoso, 2018). Some of what we know of the basic biology of these large, charismatic frogs is due to the study of captive animals (e.g., Pawley and Hutchison, 1989; Hutchison, 1998).
 
Hutchison (1998) found C. goliath to have a somewhat lower metabolic rate than other ranoid frogs. The volume of air brought in during a breath is typically small, but the frogs take frequent breaths and oxygen uptake is higher than other frogs of similar mass.

Despite having been described in 1906, little is known about the natural history of the largest frog in the world, Conraua goliath. In their recent paper, SchÃ¤fer et al. (2019) shed light on the species' reproductive behavior by documenting their construction of nest sites. The authors described three types of nesting sites they found in West Cameroon that protect developing offspring from river torrents and predators: rock pools, existing washouts, and dug-out depressions in gravel riverbanks. The different types of nest sites have differing levels of construction effort and risk of flooding or drying. However, in each of these sites, the breeding adults cleared the area of detritus and leaf-litter and deposited eggs on multiple occasions. Camera traps showed that adults guarded nests at night, which is consistent with local knowledge. The authors speculate that because large, heavy objects must be moved for nest construction, this type of nest construction may have favored large size in this species (Written by Ann T. Chang).

Animals have many mating systems ranging from polygamy of one or both sexes to monogamy. Until recently polygyny, involving a male with several females with mate fidelity, had not been observed in amphibians. New observations from de SaÌ et al. (2020) change that with their description of how Thoropa taophora males guard rare breeding sites in rock seeps over an extended period of time where they exclusively breed multiple times with two or more females. Adding to the complexity of this breeding system, females appear to display a hierarchy with the dominant female mating more often and laying more eggs in the breeding site. The authors hypothesize that the same causes of polygyny in other systems, the severe limiting of breeding sites and intense intrasexual competition for mates, accounts for the development of this mating system in Thoropa taophora (Written by Ann T. Chang)

Brazil is considered a mega-diverse country for amphibian diversity (1159 amphibian species known so far). However, it is also home to one of the global hotspots of amphibian decline, the coastal Atlantic Forest. To understand the history, nature, and response of species to the precipitous declines, Toledo and colleagues (2023) closely analysed surveys, reports, and museum records with environmental, climatic, and disease data.  Their study more than doubled the number of population declines reported in previous studies, placing the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as a global hotspot of amphibian declines with one of the highest rates of declines and extinctions. The height of decline appears to be in 1979 within a decades long trend. Populations, if they recovered, sometimes took as long as 30 or more years. Their use of museum collections showed that specimen records matched the spatiotemporal patterns of declines and extinctions, including the impact of chytridiomycoses; they suspect that historic declines might have impacted many more amphibian populations and species. They also sought correlations of life history traits and phylogeny to help explore patterns of decline. They note some families were disproportionally impacted by declines (specifically Cycloramphidae, Hylodidae, Phyllomedusidae). Their comprehensive report will be an essential guide to conservation, management, and disease surveillance to protect this important amphibian ecology. (Written by Michelle S. Koo)

Bright colors may serve to warn predators that potential prey are toxic, so one might predict that predators are the main factor driving diversification in warning signals. However, several studies of color polymorphisms in poison frogs suggest otherwise. In one study, Jeckel et al. (2019) found Adelphobates galactonotus from two localities with distinct color morphs did not differ in their toxin profiles or palatability. They suggest the color difference is unlikely to have evolved from predation pressures and instead be a product of parental imprinting and sexual selection, as was found in Oophaga pumilio by Yang et al. (2019) [News of the Week Nov 11, 2019]. In another, Rojas et al. (2019) reconstructed the evolution of color in >200 individuals of A. galactonotus and found that transitions between color morphs have occurred several times. Using mtDNA and a SNP matrix, they found population structure was mostly explained by geographic distance (not color), and that population sizes were relatively small. Rojas et al suggest that genetic drift likely played a role shaping the current diversity of colors in this species. Finally, a study by Lawrence et al. (2019) [News of the Week October 28, 2019] suggest that a suboptimal warning signal in Dendrobates tinctorius arose through drift.  These studies mark a shift in how evolutionary biologists are thinking about signal diversity in toxic animals. (Rebecca Tarvin)

In males, the snout-vent length ranges from 14.8-18.3 mm, while in females the range is 15.8-19.8 mm. The heads are slightly wider in males than females, while females are larger overall in size. The snout is blunt and broadly rounded in dorsal view, but acutely rounded when viewed laterally, and extends past the lower jaw. The tympanum is round, and partly concealed posterodorsally. Fingers decrease in length from III>I>II>IV; the third finger is not swollen in males. The forearm is slightly longer than the upper arm, and lacks an ulnar fold. The palmar tubercle is nearly round and the thenar tubercle is elliptical, and approximately one-third the diameter of the palmar tubercle. All fingers have expanded discs and no fringes. Hands lack webbing, although basal webbing is present on the feet between toes II-IV. The dorsum is granular, with granulation increasing toward the posterior (Lima et al. 2009).
Color of the dorsum varies from light grayish brown to orange brown, often with one to several dark brown hourglass, triangular, or diamond-shaped markings. Dorsal surfaces of the arm are light orange-brown, while dorsal surfaces of the legs are light gray. Thighs, shanks, and feet have dark brown crossbars. Males have green-yellow throats with a yellow chest and belly and melanophores on the gular sac, while females have white throats with a yellow outer edge, and white chests and bellies. 
No dorsolateral stripes are present. A diffuse pale tan to orangish-brown oblique lateral stripe is present, running from the midbody (sometimes starting as far forward as the arm insertion) to the groin. A ventrolateral stripe of irregular white spots runs from the anterior corner of the eye to the groin.  The pupillary ring and upper iris are metallic gold with a fine black network, and the rest of the iris is brown. 
Tadpole bodies are ellipsoid when viewed dorsally and flattened when viewed laterally. Larval snouts have small dorsolateral nostrils, and are bluntly rounded in both dorsal and lateral view. The spiracle is sinistral, directed dorsolaterally, located at midbody below the lateral midline, and is free. The vent is attached to the ventral fin. The upper tailfin starts at the junction of the body and tail, and the tail has robust caudal musculature. Emarginate, anteroventral oral disc, with papillae on lateral margin of anterior labium and surrounding posterior labium.  Lower jaw sheath is V-shaped and both upper and lower jaw sheaths are serrated.  LTRF 2(2)/3(1) (Lima et al. 2009).

Tadpoles are grayish-brown with irregular brown and silver blotches. Tadpoles of Allobates brunneus are easily distinguishable from those of the related species (A. marchesianus and A. caeruleodactylus) by the regular arrangement of papillae on the oral disc margin and irregular spots on the tail for A. brunneus (vs. unusual papillae distribution and distinct irregular stripes for the others). The oral disc of the A. brunneus tadpole has fewer surrounding papillae than that of A. subfolionidificans.  The tadpole of A. nidicola has a reduced oral disc, lacks both spiracle and vent, and has yolk-filled intestines, so is easy to distinguish from that of A. brunneus.  Not all Allobates tadpoles have been described (Lima et al. 2009).
","
Allobates brunneus is found in a number of South American countries. Populations inhabit Brazil, Bolivia (the northern tip), French Guiana (though this may refer to another species), Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela (south of the Orinoco River only).  Within the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, this species is found in lowland swamp forests areas along the banks of the slow-running Rio Casca and its tributaries, at 300-380 meters asl (Lima et al. 2009). 
","
Allobates brunneus is active during the day (diurnal). It generally lives on, or very close to the ground (Lima et al. 2009).

Males call all day, especially during periods of heavy rainfall (O600 h-1830 h), but generally mating calls are most common in the early morning (0600 h-0900 h) and late afternoon (1600 h-dusk). Calls recorded at temperatures above 28 C were sequences with groups of 6-11 notes separated by longer silent intervals. Below that temperature, notes were ungrouped and inconsistent. Males occasionally engage in wrestling bouts (Lima et al. 2009).

This species primarily lays eggs on the upper leaf surfaces of understory vegetation (10-60 cm above ground), unlike other species of Allobates, as well as occasionally inside rolled up leaves within terrestrial leaf litter. Each oviposition site has a single clutch of about 17 eggs.  Tadpoles develop within the egg jelly on the upper surface of the leaf, to about stage 25 before the parent transports the larvae to small pools in the vicinity of streams. 
","

","
The primary threat to Allobates brunneus is habitat loss due to increased agriculture. Other distinct threats include the construction of hydroelectric dams (primarily in Brazil), and logging and deforestation (Lima et al. 2009). 
Populations are present in protected areas in Venezuela (Duida Marahuaca National Park), and Bolivia (Noel Kempff Mercado National Park). 

Until 2002, a protected population could also be found in the National Park of Chapada dos GuimarÃ£es, in Brazil. However, swamp forest flooding along the Rio Casca seems to have extirpated this population.  Other populations along the Rio Manso have also been extirpated due to flooding from a newly constructed hydroelectric dam and reservoir (Lima et al. 2009). In Brazil Allobates brunneus is also found within the refuges of Rondonia and TapajÃ³s (Morales 1994).

females 33-35 mm. The dorsum is 
black or dark brown. A light brown 
dorsolateral line and a broken white 
ventrolateral line run from the snout 
to the base of the legs. The legs are 
dark brown. An orange half-moon 
shaped patch extends from the base 
of the legs onto the thigh and there is 
an orange-yellow patch behind the 
forelimb. The belly is white with 
irregular black markings, and the 
throat region is black. 

Sometimes confused with Lithodytes lineatus, which is similar in size and color, but has a yellow dorsolateral stripe that circles the whole dorsum, hind legs with alternating light and dark bars, and more than one orange patch on the thighs.

 
 

","
Found primarily in lowland forests of eastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and of the Amazon drainage of Colombia, eastern Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil; also in densely forested regions of the Napo and Pastaza drainages of Ecuador and southern Cordillera Oriental of Peru.

In the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke in Brazil, occurs principally on clay soils with seasonal pools. 
","
Diurnal and terrestrial. Adults feed mainly on beetles, ants, crickets and roaches, and juveniles eat mainly collembolans. Reproduction occurs between November and April, with a peak in January or February. Clutches contain about 8-17 eggs and are deposited out of water between fallen leaves. Development to hatching takes place between the leaves. The tadpoles are carried on the back of primarily the male parent to pools. Males are territorial, and attend the eggs and tadpoles in the leaf nest. Males court females within their territories for 2-3 days before egg-laying.

Females do not appear to respond to playback calls (HÃ¶dl 1983).

Amphibians display a wide spectrum of parental care, from abandonment after laying eggs to provisioning larvae with food after hatching or live birth, which has been considered a fixed trait. Ringler et al. (2015) tested that assumption in Allobates femoralis, a species in which males obligatorily transport tadpoles and females provide no parental care, after observing a small proportion of tadpole transportation by females over a 5 year period.  Using both previously observed data and laboratory experiments with wild-caught individuals, the authors tested if mothers transported tadpoles when fathers disappeared. The statistical and experimental results consistently showed that females compensate for unavailable males by transporting tadpoles themselves. The authors urge more cautious labelling of uniparental care as it may oversimplify parental behavioral flexibility. (Written by Ann Chang)

Picking the right spot to lay eggs or tadpoles is crucial to population persistence of aquatic breeding amphibians. Despite its relevance to population growth, relatively little is known about how frogs discover and select water bodies for egg or tadpole deposition. In a simple but clever field experiment, Serrano-Rojas and PaÅ¡ukonis (2021) demonstrate that in the tadpole-transporting Brilliant-thighed Poison Frog (Allobates femoralis), frogs (primarily males) rely on volatile cues to find pools in the tropical rainforest. Frogs were more likely to lay tadpoles in pools surrounded by decomposing litter that had been soaked in stagnant water than in pools containing cues from conspecific tadpoles and pools with clean water. Thus, frogs rely on volatile cues from litter decomposing in water to discover suitable pools where to lay their tadpoles. (Written by Alessandro Catenazzi)

Allobates talamancae is a small frog. Adult males grow to 24 mm while the females can reach 25 mm.  The dorsum is shagreened, or covered with tiny, low, rounded tubercles. This frog has a head slightly longer than wide, with a snout that is truncated from above. The first finger is longer than the second. Webbing and expanded discs are lacking on the fingers and toes.  Like all members of the frog families Aromobatidae and Dendrobatidae, a pair of shieldlike flaps is present on the top of each digit.  Males lack a swollen third finger in this species (Savage 2002; Leenders 2001).

This frog has a chocolate-brown back and light-colored body.  A dark band runs along each side of the body and head, and two white stripes run along the top and bottom of the dark band.  Barring is present on the thighs and calves.Allobates talamancae is sexually dimorphic in coloration: males have black throats and chests, while the throat and venter are white, cream, or yellow in females.  
 (Savage 2002; Leenders 2001). 
 
The larvae of A. talamancae are relatively small, growing to 12 mm in length.  The tails are long with low fins and bluntly pointed tail tips.  In this species, the oral disc is small and emarginate, with beaks and 2/3 denticle rows present. There is a broad gap in the A2 row of denticles above the mouth, and the row of marginal papillae above the mouth is also interrupted. Tadpoles are dark brown on the dorsal side, slightly lighter on the underside, and light brown on the tail. The tail fins and musculature bear dark blotches.  
 (Savage 2002).
","
The Striped Rocket Frog is found in southern Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador  
(Leenders 2001).  It inhabits lowland moist and wet forests and is also found marginally into the premontane wet forest and rainforest belt  
(Leenders 2001). It occurs at elevations up to 703 m in Costa Rica and 820 m in Colombia  
(Savage 2002). Although this frog prefers to live near montane, fast-flowing streams, it has also been found away from streams  
(Leenders 2001). 
","
This frog is diurnal (Savage 2002). It is active throughout the year, more so in rainy months 
(Savage 2002). When startled, it launches headfirst into the water, thus illustrating its common name of the Striped Rocket Frog.   
 
Male Striped Rocket Frogs make a rapid, high pitched trill, with a pause before the fourth beat: peet-peet-peet-peet 
 (Leenders 2001).  The series is repeated eight to twenty times  
(Savage 2002), at 10-20 second intervals  
(Leenders 2001). The males call during the day from the forest floor  
(Savage 2002). They prefer to call during periods of low light, usually while sitting on the leaf litter  
(Savage 2002).  However, it is the female in this species who is territorial and actively defends the territory  
(Leenders 2001). 
Allobates talamancae displays parental behavior similar to that of frogs in the genus Phyllobates  
(Leenders 2001).  Mating takes place in the leaf litter  
(Savage 2002). Females deposit their eggs in moist leaf litter, where early development occurs  
(Savage 2002).  Tadpoles are transported to water on the back of either parent, in clutch groups of 8-29 tadpoles  
(Savage 2002). 
 
The adult diet consists of a variety of small arthropods, including ants (Savage 2002).

Male Allobates zaparo have a snout to vent length range of 27.0 - 30.5 mm. Females have a snout-vent range between 26.5 - 30.5 mm. The snout is somewhat truncated to rounded in the dorsal aspect and rounded in the lateral aspect. The canthus rostralis is rounded and the loreal region is somewhat concave. The distance between eye and nostril is smaller than the eye diameter. The interorbital width is slightly longer than the width of the upper eyelid. The pupil is horizontal and rounded. The tympanum is half the diameter of the eye and the posterodrosal region is hidden. The skin on their dorsal surface of the body and limbs is granular in texture, but smooth along their ventral surface of the body and limbs. The fingers are unwebbed with the first being longer than the second and having discs that are relatively small. The hindlimbs have a strong, short tarsal fold with a bend at the proximal end located between the inner metatarsal tubercle and heel fold at the distal end and extending a third of the distance. There is a moderately developed tarsal tubercle. The toes have basal webbing between toes II, III, and IV (Silverstone 1976). 

the fingers do not have webbing or fringes, and disks of the second, third and fourth fingers are small and less than 1.5 times the width of the fingers. This species toe tips are rounded. The toes are webbed around the base of each toe and the webbing does not extend along the length of the toe. Males of this species lack nuptial pads.

Allobates zaparo resembles several other members of closely related families. Epipedobates anthonyi is visually similar, but is smaller in size and has a light median dorsal stripe. Epipedobates boulengeri is also smaller and lacks the red dorsum of A. zaparo. Epipedobates espinosai is smaller than A. zaparo. Epipedobates tricolor has green bones and a light median dorsal stripe, while A. zaparo lack this stripe and has white bones. Both A. zaparo and Ameerega parvulus have a red dorsum, but A. zaparo is larger and has basal toe webbing. Allobates zaparo and Allobates femoralis are closely related and are visually similar species within the genus. However, A. zaparo has a red dorsum, usually lacks the light lateral stripe that A. femoralis has, and has a small or absent pale proximodorsal thigh spot compared to the large one in A. femoralis (Silverstone 1976). 

In life, the dorsum of the body is red to brick-red in color outlined with thin or interrupted light-brown to copper brown lateral lines that start at the snout and extend posteriorly. The black sides of the head and flanks are bordered above by the brown lateral line and below by a white ventrolateral stripe that may become blue as it moves posteriorly. There is a greenish yellow strip on the upper lip. The dorsal surface of the forelimbs is light brown, with black or dark brown spots. The axilla region ranges from yellow to orange. The dorsal portion of the hindlimbs has a black background color, with blue-grey molting. The ventral and posterior surfaces of the thigh and calf are blue with black reticulations. The throat and chest are black, with some specimens having a blue sheen. The black extends to the belly where it becomes mottled or marbled with pale blue. The blue continues as a stripe until reaching the axillary region, which is orange in coloration. The throat is black with faint blue coloration. The stomach region is primarily blue with black splotches. The black iris has a thin band of bronze to copper color around the pupil (Silverstone 1976). 

In preservative, the granules on the dorsum are golden-brown surrounded by black. The dorsal side of both forelimbs and hindlimbs is grey in color, with faint black banding. Some individuals have a white spot on the dorsal surface of the limbs where they meet with the body. The sides of the head and body and the ventral surfaces of the head, body, and limbs maintain their black coloration. The blue coloration becomes white or grey. The lateral line may be visible on the snout, canthus, and upper eyelid or may disappear. The ventrolateral line may also become white, interrupted, or disappear. A white stripe extends from the dorsal side of the forelimbs forward across the upper lip before terminating at the nostrils (Silverstone 1976). 

There are geographic differences in A. zaparo coloration and patterning. Allobates zaparo is a Batesian mimic, which mimics the coloration of toxic species, Ameerega bilinguis and Ameerega parvulus, with which it lives in sympatry. All three species have a red granular dorsum, with the toxic species differing by variations in axilla and groin coloration. In the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon, A. zaparo resembles the slightly toxic A. bilinguis, whereas in the Southern Ecuadorian Amazon, it resembles the highly toxic species A. parvulus. Where all three species live in sympatry, A. zaparo resembles A. bilinguis (Darst and Cummings 2006). 

","
This species has a range that extends from La Cordillera de los Llanganates in central Ecuador, east of the Andes, and over the border into Peru. This species is found in rolling hills regions. Their habitat consists of old growth and well-regenerated secondary lowland tropical rainforest (Icochea et al. 2004).

Specimens have been collected along tropical humid rivers and their tributaries in the Ecuadorian Andean Cordillera, which flows into the Amazonian foreland (Grant et al. 2006), at elevations ranging from 230 to 1000 m above sea level (Silverstone 1976). Within Peru, this species exists along the northwest border, reaching as far inland as Zona Reservada Pucacuro. The species is unprotected in Peru, but occurs within Yasuni National Park in Ecuador (Icochea et al. 2004).

","
Allobates zaparo is an abundant, diurnal species that can usually be found within the leaf litter. This species is terrestrial, but has reproduction tied to water, and so is found near slow moving tropical rivers and their mountain tributaries (Silverstone 1976).

Males call from concealed positions on top of the leaf litter and from crevices in boulders to attract females. Calls could be heard in the late afternoon and early evening. The calls consisted of discrete single pulses without much frequency modulation. At 25.8 degrees Celsius in the leaf litter, the call had a mean multinote call duration of 1.524 Â± 0.594 s, a mean interval between call duration of 2.965 Â± 1.288 s, and a call rise time of 0.540 Â± 0.126 s. Each unit of repetition lasted an average of 0.185  Â± 0.012 seconds with an average of 0.313  Â± 0.021 seconds between units and 3.216  Â± 0.199 units per second. The mean number of calls per second was 0.370  Â± 0.096.  The mean number of pulses per call was 10.375 Â± 3.543 and the mean number of pulses per second was 6.709 Â± 0.398. Pulses consisted of one initial note that lasted 0.072 Â± 0.011. The single middle pulse note lasted 0.082 Â± 0.010 seconds. The initial peak frequency is 2952.900 Â± 67.551 Hz and the middle peak frequency is 3001.707  Â±99.984 Hz. The calls are loud and elaborate, which puts them at risk of predation, but they pose aposematic coloration that mimics sympatric toxic species, protecting them (Santos et al. 2014).

Unlike the basal members Dendrobatoidae, members of the genus, Allobates, do not have cephalic amplexus (Vences et al. 2000). 

Ovipositing usually takes place on leaves. When the larvae hatch, they are carried to water, where they mature and metamorphose into adults (Icochea et al. 2004, IUCN 2018). Parental transport of larvae on the dorsum is a synapomorphy of all Dendrobatidae, independently lost in only two species. Although it is not clear which sex is responsible for tadpole transport in A. zaparo, its sister group, A. femoralis, uses biparental transport (Grant et al. 2006). 

Where both A. bilinguis and A. parvulus species cohabit, A. zaparo mimics the less toxic species: A. bilinguis. This is the opposite of what would initially be predicted, that it would mimic the more toxic and more abundant species. The theory behind this is that the more toxic species teaches predators a general avoidance response, from which all species that look somewhat similar to the highly toxic species benefit. The less toxic species teaches predators a highly targeted avoidance response where they will only avoid eating individuals that look precisely like the less toxic species. By mimicking the less toxic individual, A. zaparo enjoys the benefits of both types of predator learning (Darst and Cummings 2006).

This species appears to be a dietary generalist. While a large fraction of its diet is made up of ants, specimens collected at different sites have varying proportions of ants in their diet, ranging anywhere from 11% to 74% (Darst et al. 2005). 

In the region, little is known about potential predators for species in the family Dendrobatidae, but birds are suspected predators and have been found to eat A. zaparo in experimental settings (Darst and Cummings 2006).

","

","
The population trend for this species was determined to be stable in 2018 (IUCN), and the species is not believed to be under threat. However, a major threat to the species is localized habitat loss that has occurred as a result of habitat conversion to agricultural activities (Icochea 2004, IUCN 2018). Compared to forested areas, this species experiences a 90% reduction in abundance in areas that have been converted to plantations or pastures (Beirne et al. 2013). 

While unprotected in Peru, this species does occur within Yasuni National Park in Ecuador (Icochea et al. 2004, IUCN 2018).

Prior to 2006, the genus, Allobates was considered a sister clade to some species of Colostethus, specifically, C. humiis, C. marchesianus, C. talamancae and C. triliatus (Vences et al. 2003). However, after Grant et al.'s (2006) phylogenetic analysis, those species were reassigned to Allobates. The next genus that Vences et al. (2003) found to be related to Allobates was then named Nephelobates, but was also renamed by Grant et al. (2006) to Aromobates. Within Allobates, several studies place A. zaparo sister to A. femoralis (Vences et al. 2003, Grant et al. 2006, SimÃµes et al. 2010, Santos et al. 2014).

The species epithet, â€œzaparoâ€, originates from the ZÃ¡paro Indians, native to the same region of eastern Ecuador (Silverstone 1976) 

Allobates zaparo has, at various times, been placed in the genus, Phyllobates by Silverstone in 1976, Dendrobates by Myers, Daly, and Malkin in 1978, and Epipedobates by Myers in 1987 (IUCN 2018). 

This species lacks the ability to concentrate alkaloids like other members of the Dendrobatidae family, but still resembles them in appearance, marking them as a Batesian mimic (Darst et al. 2005).

Description: Ameerega parvula is a small to medium frog, ranging in size from 17.5 mm to 24.0 mm in snout-vent-length. In males, the SVL ranges from 17.5 mm to 22.5  mm and in females 19 mm to 24 mm. Adult skin is strongly granular on the dorsum and on the dorsal surface of the hindlimbs (Silverstone 1976). Jungfer (1989) described the dorsal skin as densely covered in rounded or flattened, evenly distributed granules (Grant et al. 2006). The skin is smooth on the ventral surface of the hind limbs (Silverstone 1976). Maxillary and premaxillary teeth are present in this species. The first finger is longer than the second (Silverstone 1976), and the third finger of males is often swollen in frogs of this clade (Grant et al. 2006). Finger discs of adults in this clade are narrowly to moderately expanded. There is usually no toe webbing in adults of this clade, with at most basal webbing (Grant et al. 2006). 

Coloration in life: Adult frogs have a ground color of black, with a spotted dark red dorsum. The underside of the body and limbs can be either black with blue marbling or a blue with black marbling. This marbling extends partially onto the side of the body. There is an incomplete light blue stripe extending from the forelimbs along the upper lip, ending next to the outside of the eye or nostril (Silverstone 1976). Distinct dorsolateral stripes are absent (Brown and Twomey 2009). Also usually absent are calf-spots. A yellow axillary spot is located on the upper arm and on the thigh. However this upper arm spot can also be blue and the thigh spot can be absent. Juveniles are blueish black on the dorsum, with less blue on the underside compared to the adults. Small juveniles may lack yellow arm and thigh spots (Silverstone 1976). 

Coloration in preservation: In preserved adults, the ground color is similar to live specimens or dark brown. The upper arm and thigh-spots, if present, are usually white in color. The lateral â€œstripeâ€ usually disappears. The ventral marbling is not distinct and grey but, the marbling may disappear (Silverstone 1976). 

Diagnosis:Ameerega parvula is characterized by an incomplete light lateral stripe, differing from other members of the picta group. This species can also be distinguished from certain members of the group by its red dorsum in life and the presence of teeth. It differs from A. ingeri and A. picta by the usual absence of a light proximoventral calf-spot and from A. smaragdina by the presence of ventral marbling in life. This species can be further distinguished from A. picta by a strongly granular dorsum, the first finger being longer than the second and having maxillary and premaxillary teeth present (Silverstonei 1976).

","
A. parvula inhabits the forests of the Amazon drainage in Columbia, in Ecuador in the Napo Province (Poelman et al. 2010) and in Peruâ€™s Santiago Valley, east of the Andes (Silverstone 1976; Icochea 2010). The species is found in terrestrial habitats including lowland tropical/subtropical forests; in addition, they can be found in permanent wetland habitats such as rivers, streams, creeks, and waterfalls. They have also been found in old secondary forests (Icochea 2010). As of 1976, elevation records were from 330 to 1000 meters above sea level (Silverstone 1976).
","
Wevers (1988) reports that A. parvula is a diurnal species (Lindquist and Hetherington 1996). This species is found on the ground in leaf litter near bodies of water, such as rivers (Poelman et al. 2010). Males have been observed by Wevers (1988) to undergo ""foot-waving"" for visual communication, possibly as a display of aggression towards other males, or for courtship (Lindquist and Hetherington 1996). Tadpoles are usually found in puddles or pools on the ground (Poelman et al. 2010). These bodies of water are usually partially covered by the tree canopy (Poelman et al. 2010). Males carry the tadpole clutch on their backs from the terrestrial nets to water sources (such as puddles or slow-moving rivulets) in order to provide food for them (Poelman et al. 2010; Icochea 2010). 
A. parvula has bright, aposematic coloration and produces toxic compounds. Its skin can produce lipophilic alkaloids, as can other species of the Dendrobatidae family (Darst et al. 2005).

","
Tadpole total length ranges from 12.10 to 27.13 mm in stages 25-40. The body shape is depressed. The upper fin is deeper than the lower fin, and starts 0.11 mm posterior to where the body and tail meet. The tail is wide and deep at the bodyâ€™s base, narrows slightly at the middle point (1.98 mm deep), then continues to decrease towards the slender, rounded tip. Eyes are located on the dorsal surface. The snout is narrow and rounded on the dorsal side, whereas on the ventral side, the snout is broad and rounded. Nostrils are tiny and not easily seen, located anterodorsally. On the ventral surface, the spiracle is sinistral and the vent is dextral (Poelman et al. 2010). 

The tadpole mouth is located on the ventral side. Oral discs are present, and are normal and emarginate (Grant et al. 2006). Marginal papillae are small, and of equal size, with 6 papillae located laterally on each side of the mouth and 25 located ventrally. However, there is a good deal of variation in papillae number (ranging from 12 to 78). This variation may be due to observations of tadpoles at different stages of development. Papillae are consistently absent on the upper lip, around the dorsal gap of tooth row A-1. An A-2 gap is also present, roughly one-third the total length of the tooth row. The lower jaw sheath is V-shaped, and the upper jaw sheath is mostly straight, but can be slightly V-shaped. Jaw sheaths are finely serrated (Poelman et al. 2010). 

Live tadpoles have dark brown bodies, densely covered in darker brown to nearly black spots. The tail is pale brown at the body-tail junction, and fades to pale grayish tan at the tip. The tail musculature is covered in irregular small to medium-sized gray to dark brown specks. Dark brown spots may connect to create blotches, most often on the upper part of the tail musculature. The tail fin is transparent with many irregular dark grey flecks or spots. Tadpole hind legs are light tan, with irregular dark gray-brown flecks. The venter is transparent, and intestines are visible through the skin. The posterior end of the underside is slightly pigmented, with dark brown coloration on its anterior end (Poelman et al. 2010). 

Tadpoles in preservation generally have a light tan body and tail. The body color gradually darkens as it develops. The tail has grayish brown to dark gray flecks, but sometimes has pale brown flecks. The body has many uniform dark brown spots on its dorsal side. There is little adult coloration in preserved tadpoles, such as pale red to orange brown markings on the dorsal side. The ventral side can have a pale blue-black flecked pattern that becomes bright blue and black in adults. The ventral, posterior side of the body has a moderate amount of pigment. The ventral, anterior side is transparent with few pale and dark gray spots. Because of the transparency of its venter, guts can be seen on the ventral side. Developing legs are dark gray, darkest at the tibia (Poelman et al. 2010). 

Diagnosis:A. parvula tadpoles are very similar to the geographically sympatric species A. bilinguis in size and coloration. The two can be distinguished by small differences in the length of the second lower tooth row (P-2). In A. parvula, the P-2 row is slightly longer than the P-1 row, whereas the converse is true for A. bilinguis tadpoles. Also, the two species can be distinguished by the relative width of their tail fins. The upper fin in A. parvula is slightly wider than the lower fin, while the upper fin in A. bilinguis tadpoles is slightly narrower than the lower fin. Both A. parvula and A. bilinguis tadpoles can be diagnosed from other sympatric species based on body color and oral disc characteristics, such as papillae dorsal gaps or jaw sheath shape (Poelman et al. 2010). 
","
This species is widespread, and its population is stable. There are no major threats; large areas of suitable habitat remain. Human activity, such as agriculture (crops, livestock, etc.) has led to some local areas of habitat loss. It is potentially threatened by an increase in the pet trade (Icochea 2010). In Ecuador, A. parvula inhabits five protected areas, including Parque Nacional YasunÃ­, Parque Nacional Sangay and Limoncocha Reserva BiolÃ³gica. A. parvula is also present in Peruâ€™s Santiago Comaina Reserved Zone (Icochea 2010).
","

","
Species Authority: This species was first described by Boulenger (1882), as Dendrobates parvulus. 

Etymology: The name parvula derives from the Latin word parvulus, meaning young or small.

Phylogeny: In 1989, Jungfer determined Ameerega parvula to be a different species than A. bilinguis, a morphologically and geographically similar species, based on its vocalizations and adult morphology (Poelman et al. 2010). A. parvula thought to be the sister species to A. bilinguis, and both are in the subfamily Colostethinae (Grant et al. 2006; Poelman et al. 2010).

Ameerega trivittata is a diurnal and terrestrial frog species that is part of the Dendrobatidae family with a snout-venth length of more than 35 mm, making it one of the largest Dendrobates frog. The females are slightly larger than the males with females growing up to 50 mm and males up to 42 mm. It has a snout that slightly projects. The tympanum is roughly half of the eye's diameter. Its back has fine granules and its lateral and ventral sides are smooth.  Ameerega trivittata does not have webbing on its fingers or toes. The first finger is longer than the second. Their skin is toxic (Rodriguez and Duellman 1994; Ouboter and Jairam 2012; Cole et al. 2013). Similarly to others of its genus, A. trivittata can be identified by synapomorphies such as its granular dorsal skin texture that contain rounded or flattened granules that are distributed densely and evenly; in most dendrobatids, such as Epipedobates the granules and tubercles are irregularly scattered across the dorsal surfaces (Grant et al. 2006).

Ameerega trivittata differs from other frogs of its genus by a number of characteristics including its coloration and size (larger). It is also toothless, which allows differentiation between it and the sympatric toothed A. bassleri that has similar patterns (Silverstone 1976). 

Both its front and hind legs are yellow-green to green to light-brown. The hind legs often have some black spots on them. Both the dorsum and the flanks are black. The ventral side is also black, but its posterior has green to blue markings. The hands and feet are green with scattered pale blue spots and the arms and legs are dark green. The posterior of the thighs is black with blue spots on them. The abdomen is black with irregular pale blue or cream spots. It has two lateral stripes on either side: a dorso-lateral stripe that is green to yellow from the snout to the hind legs and a lighter, whitish stripe that goes from the eye to the front and hind leg on the ventro-lateral side. In juveniles the two green-to-yellow stripes are usually all yellow. It has large spots in the armpit and the groin. It has a black venter with blue spots and a dark brown iris (Ouboter and Jairam 2012). 

There are variations in coloration in specimens in different regions. In the Guianan Region, the lateral stripes can either be green, yellow-green, yellow, or orange. Although the dorsum is still black, there is no median dorsal stripe. In Suriname, A. trivittata displays green spots on the dorsal side of the limbs and light blue spots on the belly and ventral surface of the limbs (Cole et al. 2013).
","
Ameerega trivittata can be found on the forest floor of primary and secondary growth tropical rainforests at an elevation of 20 to 680 meters (Cole et al. 2013). It is found in both terrestrial and freshwater habitats. The species is found 500 meters above sea level in Bolivar state, Venezuela, and Guyana, Suriname. It is also found in the Amazon basin in Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and northwestern Bolivia (La Marca et al. 2004). In Suriname, the frogs live in mesophytic forests, such as savanna forests and wet mountain forests from streams. It is usually found on forest floor when it is silent, but is usually found on fallen tree-trunks when calling (Ouboter and Jairam 2012).
","
Ameerega trivittata lays terrestrial eggs, which the males take care of. The eggs are kept in clutches that are hidden under fallen leaves. The males transport the tadpoles to a suitable water source outside of the range of the male territory after they have hatched. In nature, it takes about 14 to 17 days to go from fertilization to hatching, and another 41 to 54 days after hatching to reach metamorphosis (Roithmair 1994; Silverstone 1976). 

Calling and reproduction activity are at their highest during the rainy season (from May to October) and more or less cease during dry seasons, although there have been reports of calling and reproduction occurring year-round in Suriname (Ouboter and Jairam 2012). Males have two types of calls: a long-ranged advertisement call and a short-ranged courtship call. The sound pressure is 79 dB. The courtship calls have a lower sound density than the advertising calls (67 - 70 dB). Most of the calling activity happens in the morning (Roithmair 1994; Twomey, Morales, and Summers 2008). 

Males are territorial and females are not. Males call to establish territories while perched on elevated positions (such as branches) at about 15 - 165 cm above ground, and can gain a preference for their calling sites, which can be reused up to 11 days. Their territory size ranges from 4 - 156 m2. There is no correlation between male body size and mating success; their mating success is dependent on the territory size, calling activity, and length of residency. Territorial males try not to stay too close together, with the closest distance between two territories being 5.8 m. Male-male interspecific competition is strong, especially in the first thirty days, and an increase in interspecific density can reduce the individual's survival in both lowlands and highlands. Fighting can occur between males if they get too close and is characterized by wrestling and pouncing one another with their forelimbs. Females do not display any signs of aggression. Females choose mates based on how many days they called on their territory (the longer the better) and how large their territory is. They will sometimes visit multiple territories before choosing a mate. Courtship and mating takes place in the territory. Territoriality is only for mating and not for food defense since they prey on abundant ants (Roithmair 1994; Twomey, Morales, and Summers 2008).

Ameerega trivittata, along with Colostethus talamancae and C. marchesianus, is an outgroup to other frogs of the the Dendrobates family (Roberts et al. 2006). The Ameerega genus is a sister group to Colostethus genus. This species has undergone several genus name changes due to the unclear phylogeny. Silverstone (1975) believed at this species should be classified under the Phyllobates genus because of finger morphology and chromosome evidence. He divided the Phyllobates genus into 4 groups and grouped this species together with Phyllobates bassleri into the trivittatus group due to their similar color. This group was later characterized by its vocalizations too. Myers (1978) reclassified the genus Phyllobates and the trivittatus species complex to the genus Epipedobates. Bauer (1986) later assigned the Ameerega genus to the trivittatus group. The clade is now identified by its synapomorphies (See Diagnosis) and its location because the Ameerega clade is found on in the Andes. The Ameerega genus is monophyletic with Allobates, Dendrobates, Epipedobates, Mannophryne, Oophaga, Phyllobates, and Ranitomeya (Grant et al. 2006).

This species was previously known as Epipedobates trivittatus and Hyla trivittata (La Marca et al. 2004).

There is mounting evidence that most amphibians are pretty good at finding their way home. Recently, PasÌŒukonis et al. (2018) strapped tiny radio transmitters to Three-striped Poison Frogs (Ameerega trivittata) to see how well they could navigate back to their home territories after being moved different distances. Ameerega trivittata are particularly interesting to study because they lay their eggs on land and once they hatch, adult males move their tadpole young via piggyback to bodies of water. Thus, Ameerega trivittata may be especially talented at finding their way around the forest. The researchers found that even when the frogs were moved further away from their home than they would normally travel, the frogs could navigate straight back to their home territory. This means the frogs may have a map-like navigation system; however, it is still uncertain what cues from the environment the frogs use to find their way home (Written by Molly Womack).

The larvae-toting parental care of many species of the Family Dendrobatidae is known to be an effective way to ensure tadpoles have food and protection while they develop. A study by PaÅ¡ukonis, Loretto and Rojas (2019) asked further about the role of this parental shuttling in dispersal. With tiny radio transmitters, they tracked two poison frog species (Ameerega trivittata and Dendrobates tinctorius) and found that they moved their offspring farther and to many more water sources than expected, with little regard to suitable, nearby pools. Examining the spatial patterns of the far-ranging fathers, the authors speculate on the adaptive benefits of ensuring the dispersal of their offspring to reduce competition and possible inbreeding against the increased costs and risks associated with long-distance travel. Their study highlights the parental role in offspring dispersal and the spatial acuity of these poison frogs (Written by Michelle Koo.)

Diagnosis: Andinobates fulguritus is similar to members of what was once the A. minutus group, but can be distinguished from A. altobueyensis, and A. steyermarki in having stripes. A. fulguritus can further be distinguished from A. altobueyensis in lacking a well-developed tarsal turbercle and lacking red color. A. fulguritus can further be distinguished from A. steyermarki, which has a smooth belly, in having a moderately granular belly. A. fulguritus can be distinguished from A. quinquevittatus in lacking reticulation. A. fulguritus most closely resembles A. minutus and is differentiated by an incomplete light median stripe on the anterior portion of the dorsum. The abdomen is predominantly light in preservative, whereas the abdomen in A. minutus is dark (Silverstone 1975).

Description: The snout-vent length for adults is 13.5 mm to 16.5 mm (Silverstone 1975; Jungfer et al. 1996). The dorsum is slightly granulated and the venter is moderately granulated, except for the palms and soles. A. fulguritus lacks teeth. It has a subtruncate snout tip from the dorsal aspect. This snout tip is  rounded in lateral aspect. It has a rounded canthus rostralis. The loreal region is vertical. The tympanum is round; its diameter is smaller than the eye by half the eyeâ€™s diameter. An omosternum is present. There is no webbing or fringes on the toes. It lacks a tarsal tubercle (Silverstone 1975).
Coloration: The ground color of the dorsum is gold, yellow, or yellow-green. It has complete dorsolateral and incomplete black lateral stripes. Its flanks are black. Ventral surfaces are yellow. The abdomen is gold or yellow with black marbling or spots. There are two black spots on either side of the throat and a median black throat spot that, in some frogs, join together. The anterior of the dorsum has an incomplete median stripe. The iris is black (Silverstone 1975).
Coloration in Preservation: In preservative, gold, yellow, and yellow-green coloration fade to gray and the abdomen is predominantly light (Silverstone 1975).
Tadpole morphology: Tadpoles have a laterally indented oral disk (Silverstone 1975).

Variation: Individuals vary slightly in their incomplete median stripes and dorsolateral stripe pattern. The throat patterns may also slightly vary as well as the ventral patterns, which may be marbled or spotted (Silverstone 1975).

","
A. fulguritus inhabits humid tropical forests and can not tolerate degraded forests. It is found in Central and South America. Populations are native to both Colombia and Panama and are found in the lowland forests of the Chocoan region of Colombia, in the Atrato and San Juan drainages, west of the Andes, and Panama. Populations exist at elevations of 160 to 800 m (Silverstone 1975; SolÃ­s et al. 2004).

Tadpoles were found in the leaf axils of bromeliads (Silverstone 1975).

","
A. fulguritus inhabits leaf litter (Jungfer et al. 1996). In nature they have been found to consume Hymenoptera and Acarina (Silverstone 1975). 
Eggs are carried from the deposition site on the forest floor to bromeliads for development (SolÃ­s et al. 2004).
Calls consist of irregularly repeated soft buzzing notes of a mean duration of 0.529 s and 146.8 pulses per second. Males start calling at the age of 6 months (Jungfer et al. 1996).
During mating, a male guides a female to a site, deposits sperm, and leaves. Then the female lays 1 to 5 eggs. No amplexus occurs between the male and female. Parental care is continued by the male who visits the clutch irregularly and transports the larvae singly or in small groups to different water bodies. After that, larvae are left on their own. Females start depositing clutches after 9 months (Jungfer et al. 1996).

","

","
A. fulguritus is threatened by habitat loss due to deforestation, as a result of agricultural development, illegal crops, logging, and human settlement. Pollution from the spraying of illegal crops also threatens populations (SolÃ­s et al. 2004). 
Populations do exist within protected areas such as Parque Nacional Chagres (Chagres National Park) and Area de Manejo Especial Nusagandi in Panama, and in several other protected areas in Colombia (SolÃ­s et al. 2004). 

","

","
A. fulguritus was placed under the group minutus by Silverstone (1975) along with A. altobueyensis, A. minutus, A. opisthomelas, Hyperolius quinquevittatus, and A. steyermarki. It was then placed in the genus Minyobates, which is equivalent to the minutus group after removal of several species assigned to the quinquevittatus species group by Myers (1982) and with the addition of species subsequently described by Myers and Daly Myers et al (1987). It is also listed as Ranitomeya fulgurita (Grant et al. 2006).
The name fulguritus comes from the Latin word for â€œstruck by lightningâ€ (Silverstone 1975).

In captivity, A. fulguritus does well at temperatures of 20 to 27 ÂºC. Captive individuals can be fed Drosophila melanogaster and collembolas (Jungfer et al. 1996).

Dendrobates auratus is the largest poison-dart frog in Costa Rica, with adult females ranging from 27.0-42.0 mm and adult males ranging from 25.0-39.5 mm (Leenders 2001). They can be identified by their calligraphic brilliant green markings on a black background on their dorsal side  
(Caldwell and Summers 2003).  Ventrally, they are marbled or spotted with yellow, blue, or green on dark background  (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  Among populations there are variation in both hue (ranging from white to blue-green) and pattern (from thick stripes to dots) (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  Dendrobates auratus has a smooth upper surface with a head that is relatively long.  The snout truncates to slightly rounded nose
(Savage 2002).  
","
This species is native to Central America, from the Caribbean slopes of southern Nicaragua to extreme eastern Panama, and on the Pacific slopes from the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica to Colombia (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  It lives in lowlands, primarily rainforest (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  It is a shy species, found deep in the forest interior (Leenders 2001).   

In 1932, it was introduced to Oahu, Hawaii, as a means for mosquito control, and continues to occur there (McKeown 1978, 1996).
","
These frogs forage during the day (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  They move by a series of hops, stopping briefly and hopping again when disturbed.  They are excellent climbers with individuals climbing to 45 m above the ground  
(Savage 2002).   
 
Males are territorial at high population densities but may not be at low populaton densities (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  The male call is a high-pitched, insect-like buzz sounding like ""cheez-cheez-cheez"" (Leenders 2001).  The call averages 3.5 kHz in frequency, and can last from two to four seconds followed by a five-second pause (Savage 2002).  Males can mate with many females and care for offspring of different females simultaneously (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  Females court the males and wrestle other females and chase them from their territories (Savage 2002).  This behavior increases male reproductive success but puts survival success of offspring in jeopardy, since females do not defend their territories (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  A single male can mate with up to six females (Savage 2002).  After being selected by the females, the males then lead the females to the nest site made from leaf litter and the females lay four to six eggs there (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  The male visits the eggs periodically over the incubation period to shed water, remove fungus, and rotate the eggs.  After the eggs hatch, the tadpoles crawl up on the male's back (Savage 2002).  The male then transports the tadpoles to small pools of water, usually found in tree holes (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  If some eggs hatch earlier than others, the tadpoles that are born first may practice cannibalism by eating the smaller tadpoles.   
 
The adults' diets consist mainly of tiny ants and mites but they also prey on beetles, flies, and springtails (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  They are known to have a life-span of eight years in captivity but it is much lower in the wild (Leenders 2001).
","
The tadpoles' diet consist of algae, detritus, protozoans, insect larvae, and each other (Leenders 2001). Tadpoles are moderate-sized and can reach 30 mm  (Savage, 2002). 
","
This species is not threatened (Caldwell and Summers 2003).
","
This species is popular in the pet trade due to its bright colors and various color morphs (Leenders 2001).

Birds and mammals are well-known for their behavioral flexibility and learning aptitudes, but these traits are not as well-characterized in amphibians. Liu et al. (2016) investigated these traits in the poison frog Dendrobates auratus, a species with complex reproductive strategies that may favor highly flexible forms of learning. Experiments on serial reversal learning using a two-sided maze with distal visual cues revealed that the frogs could learn to identify the correct exit. Probe trials in which visual cues were switched demonstrated that the frogs relied on these cues. Serial reversals demonstrated that the frogs learned to learn more rapidly across trials, employing rule-based strategies to solve the maze with increasing rapidity, thus demonstrating high levels of behavioral flexibility and learning ability in an amphibian (written by Kyle Summers).

Amphibian genomes can be extraordinarily large, making it difficult to connect the genotype to the phenotype using large-scale genome-sequencing methods. One approach to this challenge is to take a transcriptomic approach, focusing on differential gene expression across different phenotypes in specific tissues. Stuckert et al. (2019) take this approach to investigate differential gene expression across distinct color pattern morphs in the green and black poison frog (Dendrobates auratus). These morphs vary in both background color (brown to black) and foreground (green to blue). They sequenced transcripts from skin tissue taken from tadpoles just reaching metamorphosis, an active period for pigment deposition and skin color development. A number of candidate color pattern genes were found to be differentially expressed between morphs, including genes involved in melanin production and melanosome development in basal skin layers (e.g. the tyrosinase-related protein 1, which catalyzes several key steps in melanogenesis, and affects dark coloration in a variety of vertebrates), genes involved in the development of iridophores (middle layer organelles containing reflective structures associated with blue-green coloration), and genes involved in yellow, orange and red pigment production in xanthophores (e.g. genes in pteridine pigment production pathways). These results will begin to provide insights into the genetic underpinnings of color variation in the brightly colored Neotropical poison frogs (Written by Kyle Summers).

Can poison frogs count? Khatiwada and Burmeister (2021) address this question in the Green and Black poison frog (Dendrobates auratus). The study of counting in non-human animals has a long history, mainly focused on birds and mammals with research on amphibians being relatively rare. In this study, they used a foraging task (hunting flies) to see if the poison frog could distinguish between different numbers of flies. The frogs did well comparing small quantities (1 to 2 or 1 to 3), but beyond that did not show significant discrimination abilities. The frogs did not show any ability (or motivation) to discriminate large quantities, even with highly skewed ratios, showing they did not follow an approximate number system mediated by Weberâ€™s law. Surprisingly, their numeracy with respect to large numbers was inferior to those of plethodontid salamanders and tree frogs from previous studies. The authors suggest that the context might affect motivation, and that these frogs might show more advanced capabilities in the context of parental care (transporting and depositing tadpoles) as opposed to foraging. Hence, further research is warranted. (Written by Kyle Summers)

Many poison dart frog species (Dendrobatidae) conduct toe-tapping behavior, the quick up-and-down movement of the hind legsÂ´ middle
toes. Observational reports suggest interactions with prey animals and/or conspecifics triggering this behavior. <a target=_blank
href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10211-023-00422-8>Schulte and KÃ¶nig (2023) systematically tested the influence of big and small prey animals (crickets and fruit flies), as well as conspecific playback calls on toe-tapping behavior in the green-and-black poison frog (Dendrobates auratus). The experiments revealed that playback calls had no influence on the toe-tapping frequencies. Though, both prey species triggered toe-tapping in the frogs, no matter if the prey animals were small or big. Furthermore, the toe-tapping behavior was positively correlated to feeding events. Juvenile frogs, however, were excluded from the analyses. Even though they also showed toe-tapping behaviors, they tapped much less frequently than adult frogs. (Written by Lisa Schulte)

Dendrobates leucomelas has a snout-to-vent length ranging from 31 to 38 mm (Walls 1994). Adult frogs are black dorsally with three broad crossbands colored bright yellow, yellow-orange, or orange; black spots or blotches are often present in the crossbands as well as on the yellow or orange limbs.  The belly is black and usually lacks color.  All markings are variable, making each frog unique.  Color pattern does not seem to be correlated with geography.  D. leucomelas lacks an omosternum and the tarsal tubercle is absent or barely present (Walls 1994).

Unique glandular adhesive pads are present on the toes and fingertips, helping D. leucomelas to climb and stay in stationary positions.  D. leucomelas also lacks webbing on its feet.  Although adult D. leucomelas have been illustrated extensively, no illustrations of this species' tadpoles exist (USGS 2002).  





","
Dendrobates leucomelas is found in the Guianan Orinoco drainage of Venezuela north to the RÃ­o Orinoco, east into Guyana to the Essequibo River, south into extreme northern Brazil, and west into eastern Amazonian Colombia. 

D. leucomelas prefers moist or wet, forested, lowland regions and temperatures often reaching 30Â° C or warmer (Silverstone 1975; Honolulu Zoo 2002). They are usually found between 50 and 800 meters above sea level in leaf litter, fallen trees, forest floors, stones and occasionally trees (Honolulu Zoo 2002; Walls 1994).

They are native to South America but in 1994 one individual was collected on Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii, possibly due to a pet release (USGS 2002).



","
Dendrobates leucomelas is an insectivore (mostly ants) and is diurnal (USGS 2002; Caldwell 1996; Silverstone 1975).

 D. leucomelas is toxic in its natural environment and derives its skin toxins from the ants in its diet (Caldwell 1996). It is the only poison frog known to estivate during the dry season (Walls 1994). 

Males will chirp, buzz, trill, and hum to get females attention while also showing off their brightly colored bodies for an hour or two after sunrise and before sunset (Honolulu Zoo 2002; Walls 1994). Once a female chooses a male she will follow him to his area and stroke his back and snout.  Sometimes both the male and female will slowly circle one another and stamp their feet (Walls 1994). 
 
D. leucomelas females compete for males, and the terrestrial eggs are guarded by the male parent in a moist, sheltered area (USGS 2002).


  The male rotates the eggs every so often so that they receive enough oxygen.  Unlike most historionicus-group dendrobatids, the D. leucomelas tadpoles do not rely on eggs for nutrition but they will accept almost anything for food (Walls 1994).
  
Once they hatch, the tadpoles are carried on the father's back to small pools of water where they continue to develop (USGS 2002; Richard Stockton College 2002). 
 
Metamorphosis takes 70 to 90 days; froglets resemble miniature adults but have duller colored bands.  In captivity the froglets must eat regularly (fruit flies, pinhead crickets, and other small insects); going without food for 48 hours can lead to death.  Some people have observed that they have a ""sweet tooth"" for small caterpillars (Walls 1994).




","

","
Since D. leucomelas is easily bred in captivity, the selling price on the international market has decreased (Barrio & Fuentes 1999).
  D. leucomelas is abundant in all places sampled by Barrio and Fuentes in the late 1990's.  However, there has not been thorough monitoring to determine the current status of these frogs (Barrio & Fuentes 1998).
  Dendrobatids are exploited for the pet trade and it is believed that they are overharvested in some areas.  They could face declines unless strict trade regulations are set.  (CITES 2002).
  Their habitat is also being destroyed by timber industries and agriculture.



","
Humans keep D. leucomelas for pets and are popular species in the pet trade (USGS 2002).
  
Some compounds of their skin have pharmacological properties, and have proved to be valuable in biomedical research (Honolulu Zoo 2002).




","
Similar Species: Dendrobates auratus is an established exotic dendrobatid in Hawaii and most closely resembles D. leucomelas (USGS 2002). However, D. auratus does not have three distinct crossbands (McKeown 1996). Due to the absence of the omosternum, D. leucomelas is considered a close relative to D. historionicus (also lacking the omosternum).  But Myers and colleagues have removed D. leucomelas from the historionicus-group due to its differences in call (Walls 1994).  It has also been placed in the tinctorius-group because of its similarities to others in that group with tadpole behavior, aspects of color pattern, and its resemblance to D. auratus and D. tinctorius.  It has also been successfully bred with D. tinctorius and D. truncates (Walls 1994).

Color and pattern phenotypes in amphibians are often ecologically important. A well known example is the role of bright warning colors advertising toxicity in poison frogs of the genus Dendrobates. In a new study, Yuan et al. (2022) highlight an underappreciated axis of color pattern diversity in three species of Dendrobates (D. auratus, leucomelas, tinctorius): age-related, within individual variation. Using a long-term longitudinal study of frogs at the National Aquarium, they show that the relative area of bright color decreases and melanization increases with age in Dendrobates poison frogs. Their results set the stage for future studies to investigate the mechanism by which melanization increases with age and the ecological consequences of color pattern change in these conspicuous frogs.

A large poison dart frog of the family Dendrobatidae. [There are two morphs, one that was formerly known as Dendrobates azureus, and the previously recognized Dendrobates tinctorius.  DNA analysis has shown that these forms are conspecific. Following is a description for the morph that was formerly known as Dendrobates azureus (Wollenberg et al 2006)] This morph has bright blue-black arms and legs, paler, almost sky-blue and nearly unmarked sides, and a head and back covered with both large and small round spots.  The underside is pale blue with round black spots, especially on the breast, and sometimes with a darker midbelly stripe.  The oval tympanum is about a third of the eye diameter.  Males have noticeably larger finger discs than females. 
 
The other morph has strong yellow and black patterning on its dorsum and ventrum with blue-black arms and legs. Legs and arms may or may not have spotting. There are variations of this morph with varying amounts of yellow and strength of the yellow coloration (some are pale to almost white).

See News of the Week below for more research on the color pattern variation in this species.

The Dyeing Frog inhabits eastern Guiana Shield, including portions of Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, and much of French Guiana. 

It is found in humid, wet forests, requires rocky streams of running water, which are relatively cool, with temperatures dropping up to 22-27 degrees C at night.  Dendrobates tinctorius is found under cover, such as rocks and moss, near streams.  It usually stays on the ground, but is also found at heights up to 5 m in trees. 
","
This species is diurnal. 

Mating behavior starts with the male calling from his position in tree leaves or on the ground.  The female is attracted by his calls and strokes the male's snout and back in a typical poison frog courtship sequence.  The male then leads the female to his chosen spot, where a clutch of 2-6 eggs are laid, and attended to, in most cases, by the male, but also sometimes by the female.  The eggs hatch within 14 to 18 days, and the tadpoles are carried to water pools within bromeliad or other plant leaf axils or crevices by both the female and the male.

Tadpoles of Dendrobates tinctorius are phytotelmic.

","
The brightly colored Dendrobates tinctorius is popular in the pet trade, many of which are captive bred.

The startlingly bright colors and intricate patterns of Neotropical poison frogs are icons of warning coloration. Barnet et al. (2018) show in a recent paper that at least in Dendrobates tinctorius, the bright color patterns may simultaneously scream ""Here I am!"" to nearby would-be predators, yet be relatively undetectable to predators farther away. They measured the frogâ€™s complex patterns of yellow and blue on a black background as perceived by different types of potential predators (reptiles, birds, mammals). Using a machine learning algorithm, they assessed the ability of different visual systems to discriminate D. tinctorius from a leaf litter background at different distances. Close up, discrimination by each visual system was highly accurate, but far away, discrimination declined dramatically. In the field, they used model frogs with different color patterns to show that cryptic (brown and black) models had fewer predation attempts against a natural leaf-litter background, whereas background did not affect the attack rates on purely aposematic (bright yellow) models. The tinctorius color pattern also had lower attack rates against the natural background, indicating an element of protective camouflage. Experiments with human ""predators"" trying to find frogs on a computer screen showed the tinctorius color pattern was just as aposematic as the bright yellow morph close-up, but from a distance was just as hard to see as cryptic coloration. They conclude a kind of perceptual averaging occurs, in which the different colors of the intricate pattern blend together at a distance, making the frogs virtually invisible in their natural background (Written by Kyle Summers).

The larvae-toting parental care of many species of the Family Dendrobatidae is known to be an effective way to ensure tadpoles have food and protection while they develop. A study by PaÅ¡ukonis, Loretto and Rojas (2019) asked further about the role of this parental shuttling in dispersal. With tiny radio transmitters, they tracked two poison frog species (Ameerega trivittata and Dendrobates tinctorius) and found that they moved their offsprings farther and to many more water sources than expected, with little regard to suitable, nearby pools. Examining the spatial patterns of the far-ranging fathers, the authors speculate on the adaptive benefits of ensuring the dispersal of their offspring to reduce competition and possible inbreeding against the increased costs and risks associated with long-distance travel. Their study highlights the parental role in offspring dispersal and the spatial acuity of these poison frogs (Written by Michelle Koo.)

The evolution of warning signals, such as bright coloration, by chemically defended organisms is of key interest in evolutionary biology. We expect warning signals to be stable and conservative, so would-be predators can rely on these signals to avoid ingesting harmful toxins. Yet in many cases warning coloration is highly variable across species and populations, even within populations. Lawrence et al. (2019) use a variety of tests to investigate color variation between two populations (one with white, and one with yellow stripes) of the dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius, known for its extraordinary color pattern variation. Using Plasticene frog models in the field, they show white striped frogs were protected in the range of the yellow frogs, but suffered higher attack rates in their own range, compared to the yellow frogs. The yellow frogs had lower overall levels of toxins, yet were more aversive to bird predators. Hence, white colored individuals would be protected in the range of the (highly aversive) yellow frogs, potentially leading to polymorphism. If individuals with the white stripes colonized a new habitat and became isolated (founder effect), this could lead to the formation of an all-white population. This may be what produced the between-population variation currently observed between the two D. tinctorius populations in this study. Genetic analyses revealed a complete lack of gene flow between the populations, which would shield the white population from invasion by the yellow phenotype (Written by Kyle Summers).

Early studies to identify chemicals in poisonous frogs from South America were hampered by the limited resolution of mass spectrometry tools in the 1970s. Skin extracts from several hundred frogs were needed for scientists to obtain enough of a single compound to reveal its chemical structure. Over the following 20 years, advances in the sensitivity of these tools revolutionized the ability to describe the chemical structure of compounds new to Western science using only tiny quantities. A new tool allows even more innovative research into the chemical biology of amphibians. Krieger et al (2022) report an adaptation of the MasSpec Pen that allows real-time quantification of alkaloids and metabolites on frog skin that does not require biopsies or euthanasia. The MasSpec Pen is a hand-held device that, when pressed onto amphibian skin for 10-15 seconds, dissolves skin secretions into a droplet of solution containing water and a small amount of ethanol. The pen then ports the sample through a tube into a mass spectrometry machine where compounds are ionized and researchers can determine their identities. Such a tool can be valuable in repeated sampling of the same individuals, and future adaptations of the tool could even allow real-time sampling in the field. (Written by Rebecca Tarvin)

Adult males reach sizes between 19-24.5 mm snout-vent length, while females grow slightly bigger at 21.5-26.5 mm snout-vent length (Caldwell and Summers 2003, as E. tricolor; see Comments section for note on taxonomy).  Hind limbs are short and powerful. As is the case for all dendrobatids, divided scutes are present on the fingers and toes (Caldwell and Summers 2003). Adults are red with yellow or white oblique lateral and mid-dorsal stripes (Graham et al. 2004). 
 

","
Occurs in the El Oro, Azuay, and Loja provinces of southwestern Ecuador and the  Piura, and Tumbes departments of northwestern Peru, from 153-1,769 m above sea level.  It has also been reported from Ancash but this record is considered doubtful. The type locality is in southwestern Ecuador (Salvia, El Oro Province). This species is found in subtropical dry forest and moist lowlands near streams, including degraded forest (Coloma et al. 2004).  

","
Adults are diurnal and terrestrial, often active in early morning and late afternoon in dense vegetation near small pools of water (Caldwell and Summers 2003).  Dendrobatid breeding occurs during the rainy season, during which time males are territorial (Caldwell and Summers 2003). The advertisement call is a trill, with tonal structure (Zimmermann 1989). Territories include nesting sites, where the female lays the eggs during cephalic amplexus (Zimmermann 1989). During amplexus, before the female lays her eggs, the male gives courtship calls, which consist of a short series of croaks (Zimmermann 1989).

Clutches consist of 15-40 eggs which are roughly 2 mm in diameter (Coloma et al. 2004; Zimmermann 1989). Eggs are laid in leaf litter (Coloma et al. 2004). Parental care is given by the male, who guards the eggs for up to two weeks until they hatch (Zimmermann 1989). The male also moistens the eggs periodically and will engage intruding frogs in physical combat to defend the clutch (Zimmermann 1989).  On hatching, the male carries all tadpoles on his back simultaneously to a nearby pool of water or stream, where the larval stage is completed without any further parental involvement (Zimmermann 1989; Coloma et al. 2004).  Development takes about sixty days, culminating in metamorphosis into froglets that are about 11 mm in snout-vent length (Zimmermann 1989). The gastrulation phase of early development in this species has been studied in depth (Moya et al. 2007). 


Adults eat tiny arthropods, mostly small insects (Coloma et al. 2004).

Since this species has skin toxins, the red coloration of adults is considered aposematic (warning potential predators of toxicity), although the toxicity of E. anthonyi/ E. tricolor is less than for other species of dendrobatid frogs (Summers and Clough 2001). 

This species is considered abundant but declining (Coloma et al. 2004).

","

","
Epipedobates anthonyi is considered an abundant species in southern Ecuador but the population is declining due to habitat degradation from waterway pollution. It is not known whether part of this speciesâ€™ habitat occurs in a protected area (Coloma et al. 2004). 
","
Frogs in the genus Epipedobates produce lipophilic skin toxins consisting of piperidine-based alkaloids (Toft 1995). Epipedobates anthonyi is less toxic than species in the genera Phyllobates and Dendrobates (Graham et al. 2004). E. anthonyi rarely has class A or B pumiliotoxins, and 3,5-disubstituted indolizidines are not found at all (Summers and Clough 2001). 

Skin secretions of Epipedobates have been used in medical research. Epibatidine, a lipophilic skin toxin, is a piperidine-based alkaloid which acts as a non-opioid painkiller by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and has been found to be 200 times more potent than morphine. Although published papers on epibatidine refer to E. tricolor (e.g. Daly et al. 1987, Myers et al. 2000), the species used is very likely to have been E. anthonyi, based on the type localities for each (Graham et al. 2004; Darst and Cannatella 2005). Despite the analgesic properties of this trace skin secretion, Daly et al. (2000) state that native Ecuadorians did not have knowledge of it, nor did they make use of either frog species for medicinal purposes. 

Although epibatidine is effective as an analgesic, it is also toxic in low doses, with the toxicity thought to be due to binding to many different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. A number of derivatives of epibatidine with greater specificity and potentially lower toxicity have been synthesized in the laboratory. Several are being investigated as potential novel analgesic drugs, since this class of compound is both potent and does not induce tolerance over time as morphine does (Daly et al. 2000).

As is the case for other dendrobatid skin toxins, epibatidine appears to be derived entirely from dietary sources. E. tricolor/E. anthonyi frogs collected from a cocoa plantation contained trace amounts of epibatidine, while those collected from a nearby banana plantation did not. In addition, captive frogs lacked epibatidine entirely.  Thus the dietary source of epibatidine is likely to be present in low quantities and not universally distributed (Daly et al. 2000). 

This species has also been used in research on amphibian developmental biology (Moya et al. 2007).
","
Epipedobates anthonyi is part of the Epipedobates tricolor clade,  considered in the literature as either a separate species (e.g. Schulte 1999), or conspecific with E. tricolor (e.g. Santos et al. 2003, but see Graham et al. 2004 for debate), or pooled with E. tricolor (e.g. Summers and Clough 2001). Thus, descriptions may apply to E. tricolor as well as E. anthonyi in some instances (see Graham et al. 2004 for a review). 

The type locality of E. anthonyi is in southwestern Ecuador (Salvia, El Oro Province), while that of E. tricolor lies in central Ecuador, on the western slopes of the Andes (El Porvenir, BolÃ­var Province) (Darst and Cannatella 2005).

Diagnosis: Epipedobates tricolor differs from members of the femoralis group by having green bones and a different striping pattern. It differs from E. anthonyi by its larger size (Silvertone 1976).
Description:&#8232; E. tricolor has a snout-vent length of approximately 22.6 mm (Hermans et al. 2002; Silverstone 1976). The skin is smooth all over the body. The projecting snout is truncate. The nostril is closer to the snout than the eye. The canthus rostralis is angular and the loreal region is vertical. A distinct tympanum is present (Boulenger 1899). The second finger is shorter than the first. Toes are basally webbed (Silverstone 1976).  
Coloration: The ground color is usually dark red to brown. Three yellow-white stripes are present on the dorsum (Forsman and Hag 2006). The venter has black or brown marbling (Silverstone 1976). Hind limbs have bright red spots (Duellman and Wild 1993).
Variation: Individuals can be identified by their stripe patterns which vary (Hermans et al. 2002). 

","
E. tricolor is native to Ecuador and is found in seven locations on the Andean slopes of the Bolivar province in central Ecuador, at an elevation of 1,000 to 1,769 m (Stuart et al. 2008). 
It inhabits leaf litter on the forest floor and in wetlands (Forsman and Hag 2006; Stuart et al. 2008). 

","
E. tricolor is diurnal (Hermans et al. 2002). Calling consists of both calls and chirps and takes place on the ground or on perches. Calls recorded occurred mostly during the morning. Those made on the perch were stronger and louder than those made on the ground (Forsman and Hag 2006; Hermans et al. 2002). The duration and quality are signs of dominant males. However, these behaviors may change during the mating season (Forsman and Hag 2006).
 Male to male aggression is present in the species. Both males become erect, with front legs facing outward. The males will clutch one another, while standing up straight. They then circle each other until one can gain the upper hand and force the other to the ground, by laying on him (Hermans et al. 2002).
This species is oviparous. The clutch size is about 10 eggs. Males care for eggs in leaf litter, then carry tadpoles on their backs to be deposited in water (Forsman and Hag 2006). 
Its diet consists of small insects (Forsman and Hag 2006). 


","

","
The population is declining in the northern portion of its range, where some populations have disappeared. Major threats include the pollution of water, the loss of habitat, and overharvest for medicinal purposes (Stuart et al. 2008).
","
This species is collected for medicinal purposes (Stuart et al. 2008). 
","
The species was originally described by Boulenger (1899).
 E. tricolor and E. anthonyi were recently separated from one another (Stuart et al. 2008).


E. tricolor produces a toxin that includes epibatidine, which is an alkaloid (Gomez-Sanchez et al. 2007).

Males of this moderately small species of Colostethus attain a snout-vent length of 22.2 mm, females, 26.0 mm.  The discs on the fingers and toes are expanded, half again the width of the penultimate phalange.  Finger I is longer than Finger II, and Finger III is not swollen in males.  Lateral fringes are present on the fingers and toes.  An outer tarsal fold and tarsal tubercle are absent; the inner tarsal fold is curved and distinct on the distal half of the tarsus. The toes are webbed basally.  The dorsum is reddish brown with dark brown middorsal marks, the anterior two or three of which are broadly chevron-shaped, and the posterior two usually are round, quadrangular, or elongate. The upper lips and proximal dorsal surfaces of the upper arms are white; the rest of the forearms are brown with diffuse grayish white mottling.  Dorsolateral and ventrolateral stripes are absent.  The oblique lateral stripes are creamy white; the flanks are gray mottled with brown.  The dorsal surfaces of the thighs are dull brown with darker brown markings ranging from irregular spots to transverse bars; the anterior surfaces of the thighs are brown with a narrow creamy-white longitudinal stripe connected to an oblique lateral stripe in the groin.  The throat is gray with a pair of black spots; the belly is creamy white, and the ventral surfaces of the hind limbs are pale gray with a diffuse, dull orange spot on the proximal ventral surface of each shank.  The digital scutes are white to pale gray, in contrast to the brown digits; the iris bronze is with black flecks.  A median lingual process is absent, and the testes are white (Duellman 2004). 
 
The tadpole at Stage 34 has a body length of 13.0 mm and a total length of 38.8 mm.  The body is globular, wider than high.  The snout is rounded in dorsal view and in profile.  The moderately large eyes are situated and directed dorsolaterally and not visible from below. The spiracle is sinistral, short, and attached for its entire length to the body wall; the spiracular opening is directed posterodorsally well below midline at about midlength of the body.  The cloacal tube is short, dextral, and attached to the ventral fin.  The caudal musculature is robust and about equal in height throughout the proximal half of tail, whereupon it diminishes gradually to a pointed terminus.  The dorsal fin originates on the base of the caudal musculature, reaches its greatest height at about midlength of the tail, and diminishes to a bluntly rounded tip; the ventral fin originates on the body wall and reaches its greatest height just posterior to the midlength of the tail.  The oral disc is directed anterolaterally.  The median half of the anterior labium is bare; elsewhere the labia bear a single row of slender, pointed marginal papillae.  The labia are infolded laterally; a few small, round papillae are present in the folds. The jaw sheaths are moderately slender and coarsely serrate; the anterior sheath forms a broad arch, and the lower sheath is broadly V-shaped.  The labial tooth row formula is 2(1)/3; A2 is the longest, P3 the shortest, and other rows equal in length.  The body is olive brown, and the tail is brown with olive flecks; the iris is pale bronze.  Recently metamorphosed young are colored like adults except they are slightly paler and lack dark spots on throat.

Hyloxalus insulatus inhabits the middle RÃ­o MaraÃ±Ã³n Valley in northern Peru, where it is known from elevations of 1260 to 2600 m.  This region supports dry scrub forest, which in some areas is dominated by cacti.  A few small streams cascade down the steep slopes from the adjacent highlands of the Cordillera Occidental and Cordillera Central.  This species occurs around small streams and associated waterfalls, or seepage areas.
","
Hyloxalus were found by day on and under rocks adjacent to streams and especially in spray zones of waterfalls; others were under rocks in seepage areas or adjacent to small spring-fed streams.  Tadpoles were found in quiet pools in the streams.

This species is widely distributed at elevations of 360â€“1500 m in the western fringe of the Amazon Basin and lower Andean slopes in southern Ecuador and northern Peru; it also occurs at elevations of 325 and 520 m on the western slope of the northern part of the Cordillera Central in northern Peru.  Most individuals are active by day along rocky streams, but some have been on boulders in streams at night.  One juvenile and one adult male carrying tadpoles were on leaves in the spray zone of a waterfall at night; another male carrying tadpoles was on a rock in a stream by day.  Free-swimming tadpoles were in pools in streams. Near Tarapoto, Peru, this species was found sympatrically with Hyloxalus ornatus

A small dendrobatid species (18-22 mm) with granular skin (Savage 2002). The typical color of the back and the upper arms is bright orange to red (Savage 2002). The belly, lower arms and the hind legs are green to blue-green (Savage 2002). Calling males have a black vocal pouch (Goodman 1971). In the area of Quepos, Costa Rica, this species has an olive-colored dorsum (Meyer 1996).  

According to van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os (1992), the only sympatric congener of O. granulifera is Dendrobates auratus and the larger tadpoles of D. auratus have a denticle formula of 2(1)(2)/3 and two rows of smaller papillae, in contrast to those of O. granulifera, where the denticle formula is 1[1]/1 and there is a single row of large papillae.  Myers et al. (1995) also reported Oophaga pumilio to be in sympatry with O. granulifera.

In life and in preservative, tadpole coloration is suffused with gray that lightens from the dorsum to the venter (van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992).
","
Oophaga granulifera occurs mainly in southwestern Costa Rica, on low mountains near Puntarenas, Costa Rica, at elevations from 20 m - 100 m above sea level (Meyer 1992, 1993; Savage 2002; Stuart et al. 2008).  Its range extends down into the adjacent southwestern region of Panama (Young et al. 1999; IbaÃ±ez et al. 2000). It has also been found in much smaller numbers along the Atlantic Coast, in a region of southeastern Costa Rica adjacent to Panama (Myers et al. 1995).  It occurs in humid lowland forest, near streams, and has been reported from both undisturbed primary forest (Meyer et al. 1993; Miller and McFarlane 2008) and secondary forest (van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992; Miller and McFarlane 2008) as well as plantations (Stuart et al. 2008) and bamboo habitat (Miller and McFarlane 2008). However, it appears to be far more common in primary forest (Meyer et al. 1993; Miller and McFarlane 2008). 


","
Like most other dendrobatid frogs, the Granular Poison Frog is diurnal and terrestrial, protected from predation by its aposematic coloration. This species is highly territorial (Goodman 1971; Crump 1972; BolaÃ±os 1990; van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994), showing male-male physical aggression (Goodman 1971; Crump 1972).  Territoriality in this species involves defending calling sites and oviposition sites (BolaÃ±os 1990), and is vocally mediated (van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994). Color recognition may not be a key factor in male-male or intraspecies recognition in O. granulifera, since an O. granulifera male was observed to attack both a female O. granulifera and a similar-sized but cryptically-colored Eleutherodactylus that were positioned near a loudspeaker during the playback of male vocalizations (van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994). 

Although Myers and Daly (1976) characterized this species as calling ""incessantly,"" BolaÃ±os et al. (1990) found a bimodal calling pattern, with the most active calling period in early morning and a second calling period in the last hour before dusk. Males observed in a three-week study by van Wijngaarden and van Gool (1994) had one to three fixed calling sites and occupied those sites more frequently between the hours of 5 am and 10 am than after 10 am.  Calling sites are elevated, 0.7 m to 1.5 m above the ground (van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994; Crump 1972; Goodman 1971). Meyer (1993) states that the courtship call is distinguished from that of other dendrobatid species by its long notes, while Myers and Daly (1976) describe the advertisement call as a ""chirp"" call rather than the buzz call used by some other species of dendrobatids.  According to Myers and Daly (1976), chirp calls are a series of harsh and not well-modulated notes, with rapid pulses that cannot be resolved on wide-band sound spectrograms. Meyer (1996) noted differences in advertisement call structure among south to central Costa Rican populations
of this species.

During the rainy season, receptive females approach calling males, who then lead the females to an oviposition site (Crump 1972; van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994). Males sometimes continue to call softly while leading the female (van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994).  Eggs are laid on dead, curled-up leaves that are elevated and covered by other leaves; oviposition sites were observed to be in twig forks at 0.15-0.2 m above ground, between stones on a boulder at 0.5 m, and in a bromeliad leaf axil, about 2.5 m above the calling site on a tree (van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994). Clutches laid by members of the D. histrionicus species group usually consist of 3-4 eggs (Crump 1972; van Wijngaarden and van Gool 1994). Males attend the clutch and perform hydric brooding on a daily basis, moistening the eggs periodically with water from the bladder (Meyer 1992; Meyer 1993). Females continue to lay small clutches of fertilized eggs until the first clutch hatches (Meyer 1993).  At that point the female transports her tadpoles to water-filled sites in plants (Meyer 1993). Tadpoles are usually transported one at a time but occasionally a female will transport two tadpoles at once (van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992). Tadpole brooding sites observed in the wild by van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os (1992) included a leaf axil of a Heliconia plant, 0.15 m above the ground; the broken stem of a palm tree, 0.8 m above ground; leaf axils of various species of Dieffenbachia plants, 0.6-0.95 m above ground; the broken stem of a shrub, 1.5 m above ground; and in a bromeliad (Guzmania sp.), 3.0 m above ground.  For the six observed Dieffenbachia tadpole brooding sites, the mean water volume was found to be 2.4 ml (van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992).  Tadpoles were generally found singly (n=10), but on one occasion two tadpoles were found in the same brooding site (van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992).

Larvae are oophagous; the female visits each plant axil and lays unfertilized eggs to provide nutrition for the growing tadpoles (Meyer 1993). The tadpoles perform a complicated swimming behavior that appears to signal the female to lay the nutritive eggs (Meyer 1993). In the wild, under natural conditions, development takes approximately 80 days; in captivity when fed with chicken egg yolk, development requires about 200 days, and some of the captive larvae are only able to metamorphose when also fed thyroxin (Meyer 1993). 

During the dry season (January to April) it is difficult to find any individuals. BolaÃ±os et al. (1990), during a one-year study, found that O. granulifera left the study area in the dry season but returned in the wet season.




","
A stage 28 tadpole was collected after deposition was observed and was described by van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os (1992). Total length at stage 28 was 17.8 mm and body length was 5.8 mm. For a different specimen at stage 39 the total length was 25 mm and the body length was 8.5 mm. Tail length was consistently 67% of body length from stage 25 to stage 39. The tadpole has a depressed body.  The snout is rounded in dorsal view at all stages, but different specimens varied in profile from ""edge-shaped"" at stage 25 to rounded at stages 26-34, to truncate in stages 27 and 39. Nostrils are dorsal and are directed laterally.  Eyes are dorsal and directed dorsolaterally. Mouth is anteroventral.  Oral disc is not emarginate.  Dental formula is 1[1]/1. Labial teeth are present in a single anterior row (A1) and single posterior row (P1); A1 is irregularly interrupted while P1 is continuous and longer than A1. Anterior jaw sheath is widely arched with slender marginal processes and finely serrated; the posterior jaw sheath is also arched and finely serrated. Jaw sheath keratinization was incomplete at stages 25-27. Single row of large marginal papillae borders the posterior labium. The spiracle is low and sinistral and the vent is medial. Tail fins are equal in height; the dorsal tail fin does not extend onto the body. Tail tip is attenuated in the specimen described by van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992, but has been reported as rounded by other workers (Silverstone 1975; see van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992). Meyer (1993) observed that the tadpoles have epidermal tubes at the tail base, the function of which is unknown, but van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os (1992) did not report this feature.
","
Although Oophaga granulifera is still relatively common in southwestern Costa Rica, its population is declining (Stuart et al. 2008). In southeastern Costa Rica it is considerably less common than its congener O. pumilio, with Myers et al. (1995) observing only four individuals of O. granulifera for every hundred O. pumilio. The habitat of this species is fragmented, and is under threat of becoming further fragmented due to forest destruction (Stuart et al. 2008). Logging, agriculture, and expanding human settlement thus present the greatest threats (Stuart et al. 2008). Although Meyer et al. (1993) did not find this species outside of closed primary rainforest or away from fast-flowing streams, it has been reported from secondary forest (van Wijngaarden and BolaÃ±os 1992) and plantations as well (Stuart et al. 2008).  However, Miller and McFarlane (2007) reported that densities were considerably lower in secondary forest and considered secondary forest likely to be unsuitable habitat. The range overlaps with several protected areas, including Parque Nacional Corcovado (Summers 2000) and the Firestone Reserve (Miller and McFarlane 2008) in Costa Rica.
","
Oophaga granulifera is captured for the pet trade, despite the toxicity of its skin (see Daly et al. 1978 and numerous other publications by Daly and Myers for toxins found in this species).  Captive breeding of O. granulifera was accomplished for the first time in 1992 (Meyer 1992).
","
The karotype is 2n=20 (Rasotto et al. 1987).

This species was transferred to the genus Oophaga by Grant et al. (2006) and subsequently back to the genus Dendrobates by Santos et al. (2009). In 2011, the genus Dendrobates was subdivided into seven genera, including the new genus Oophaga by Brown et al (2011). 
 
This species was featured as News of the Week on 13 February 2023: 
Poison frogs, with bright colors and potent skin toxins, represent iconic examples of aposematism in rainforests throughout South and Central America. These frogs are also known for intensive parental careâ€“ parents carry tadpoles to small pools (phytotelmata) and some species provide trophic eggs as food for their offsprings. Much interest has focused on the question of whether poison frog tadpoles can acquire toxins for protection from predators by consuming eggs from their mothers. Studies have shown two species of Oophaga provide toxins to their tadpoles via obligate trophic egg feeding. In contrast, in Ranitomeya variabilis (and related R. fantastica, R. summersi) do not provide unfertilized eggs to their tadpoles (instead, they subsist on detritus, algae, and insect larvae), although they will sometimes lay fertilized clutches in or above pools that are later cannibalized by tadpoles.  Villanueva et al. (2022) investigate this issue in a third species of Oophaga (O. granulifera) and in Ranitomeya imitator and R. variabilis. They found that while O. granulifera receives toxins in its eggs (like other members of this genus), that was not true for either species of Ranitomeya. They infer the degree to which egg feeding is facultative (high in R. variabilis, low in R. imitator, not facultative in Oophaga) is related to the evolution of toxin transfer via egg feeding. This is only a single comparison between the Oophaga and Ranitomeya lineages, so further studies will be necessary for definitive conclusions, but their study provides a fascinating and promising first pass at this question.

Oophaga histrionica has smooth skin, and no tarsal tubercle. The ornosternum is lacking. Individuals exhibit a number of different color patterns, with most being a variation of one to many red, orange, or yellow spots on a black or brown background.  The male is usually the same size or larger than the female (Walls 1994). 
 

 
 

","
Its range includes the mostly lowland rainforests (0-300 m) of Colombia and Ecuador, but this species has also (more rarely) been found at elevations over 1100 m (Walls 1994).   
 
 
 
 

","
The male calls from a low perch, between 0 and 1 meters above the ground, to attract females.  Either the male and/or the female leads the way to an egg-laying site, which is not pre-determined by the male.  The male often touches the back of the female, and sits on her back on the way to the site.  The male and female have a complex courtship ritual, which includes a 2 to 3 hour long sequence of various sitting, bowing (only done by the female), crouching, touching, and circling behaviors.  It is thought that the female is the one who carries the tadpoles to water pools in bromeliad or other plant leaf axils or in crevices (Walls 1994).  
Females have been observed eating or destroying the eggs in other females' clutches (Duellman and Trueb 1986).

Lehmann's frog males and females reach 31 to 36 mm in length.  Its skin is smooth and the first digit is a little shorter than the second.  Three color morphs exist.  Red, orange, and yellow against dark brown or black background.  Most of the frog is dark but it is encircled by two brightly colored bands; one behind the head and the other around the hump of the back.  This pattern continues on the belly.  Each individual displays different patterns.  Arms and legs also have colored bands.  The toes in males are silver at the tips.   
 
This bright color pattern is known as an aposematic coloration and warns against predators.  Oophaga lehmanni is poisonous in the wild but in captivity it does not consume the food it needs to become toxic.  This species is most similar to Oophaga histrionicus but lacks the histrionicotoxins which are present in O. histrionicus  
(Walls 1994). 

","
Oophaga lehmanni is known only from its type locality: ""montane forest approximately 13 km west of Dagua (town), 850-1200 meters elevation on south-facing versant of upper RÃ­o AnchicayÃ¡ drainage, Department of Valle, Colombia"" (Myers and Daly 1976). 
 This is a very small range but recent specimens collected from this area have been quite different in color and pattern from typical specimens and this suggests that perhaps they are coming from a new locality or that there is substantial variation within a single population (Walls 1994). 


","
Oophaga lehmanni primarily eats insects and is active during the day.  Immediately after the rainy season males find appropriate places to store eggs (near water and safe from predators) and attract females by a series of calls.  Once the female chooses a male she will deposit a few large eggs about 1.2 m above the forest floor on leaves within the area that the male selected.  The male fertilizes the eggs and looks after them to insure their survival.  He periodically rotates the eggs to insure they receive enough oxygen.  2 to 4 weeks following fertilization, the male carries the eggs on his back via a sticky mucous.  Due to the cannibalistic nature of the tadpoles, he takes each one to a different site.  Tadpoles are fed unfertilized eggs from the female.  Common areas for tadpoles to mature include bromeliads, hollow trees, and bamboo stalks.  It takes 2 to 3 months for tadpoles to develop into adults.   
Oophaga lehmanni can breed successfully with Oophaga histrionicus in captivity.  Other than its lack of histrionicotoxins, O. lehmanni does not vary from O. histrionicus and so its status as a distinct species has often been questioned  
(Walls 1994). 
 
  
 
In a study of frog advertisement calls, it was suggested that there are two groups of dendrobatid frogs: northern populations with relatively long notes (125 ms) and a low note repetition rate (2-3.5/s) and southern populations (including D. lehmanni) with distinctively shorter notes (100 ms) and a higher note repetition rate of at least 5/s).  The authors stress that more investigation is needed.

Oophaga lehmanni is popular in the pet trade. 
 However, these frogs are very delicate and when first imported, almost all died; now they are rare in the pet trade and only recommended for experienced caretakers (Walls 1994). 
 Some compounds of their skin have pharmacological properties, and have proved to be valuable in biomedical research. (Honolulu Zoo 2002).

This is a small brightly colored frog; with total body length size of 17-24 mm. The skin is relatively smooth, and the ""usual"" coloration includes a bright red back, some small black spots, black to dark blue hind legs, and a red belly, which occasionally is red and blue, and can vary toward tan and white in some Panamanian localities.  

Unusual color variations occur on the small islands off the coast of Panama (in the Bocas del Toro archipelago), including these color combinations: blue above and below, without spots; green above and below with small spots; green above and white below, with small spots; red above and white below, with small spots; and olive green above and yellow below, with black flecks. In each population there is generally only a single color morph, but on the Island of Bastimentos there are different colors in one population. Males have a tan-grayish vocal pouch under the throat, visible when they call to defend their territory. When removed from their territory, they lose the vocal pouch coloration fairly rapidly (Summers et al. 1997).
","
Oophaga pumilio is found in the rainforests of the Caribbean coast of Central America, from Nicaragua to Panama, between sea level and 960 m (Walls 1994).  

","
More males call during the rainy season and female do not ovulate during the drier period. The male call is described as a low buzz or ticking note call, and is used to attract females and as a territorial advertisement call  
(Walls 1994). There are 4 different calls (Zimmermann 1990). The call most heard is used for territorial defense in the morning, between 8 and 10 am. Males defend territories, approximately 3 m apart from other males  (Walls 1994).   
 
The female approaches the male to initiate breeding.  It is the role of the male to tend to the terrestrial clutch of eggs (3-17 eggs), and to keep them moist by periodically emptying their bladders on the eggs (hydric brooding) until they hatch (after 5-15 days). Males may protect more than one clutch at a time. The female then carries the individual tadpoles (1-2) to separate, water filled leaf axils of bromeliads or other plants. If two tadpoles are brought to one bromeliad, only one will survive.  The female lays unfertilized eggs in with the tadpoles to serve as a food source, and she is thus able to maintain as many as six tadpoles through metamorphosis (Duellman and Trueb 1986).  
Metamorphosis is complete in 6-8 weeks.   
 
Adults of this species primarily consume ants. 

These frogs are brightly colored and toxic, and the bright coloration has multiple functions. First, it functions in defense: the coloration warns predators that these frogs are not palatable (aposematic coloration). Second, it functions in mate choice: female strawberry poison dart frogs have been shown to preferentially choose males based on brightness and color. Now a third role has been shown in a recent Evolution paper: male-male competition (Crothers et al. 2011). Brighter males defend their territory more strongly, preferentially approaching brighter intruders rather than dull-colored ones, initiating confrontation more quickly, and directing more calls to brighter rivals.  This may be particularly relevant in highly polymorphic populations of O. pumilio such as those of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago. In species where males provide some parental care (hydric brooding of the egg clutch, in the case of O. pumilio), sexually selected traits such as male color brightness are predicted to function as indicators of individual condition/quality. 
 

 Oophaga pumilio of Central America has undergone a dramatic radiation in color pattern across allopatric populations living on different Panamanian islands of the Bocas del Toro archipelago and the nearby mainland. Previous research had found that a number of the island populations showed biased mating preferences toward the color pattern of their own population, suggesting that sexual selection is driving divergence, reproductive isolation and ultimately speciation. In a transition zone between red and blue frogs, Yang et al (2016) carried out a key test of whether mating preferences are likely drivers of reproductive isolation and speciation by comparing preferences of a contact zone population where individuals encounter pure morphs (red and blue) and intermediates. As expected, they found that pure morphs from either side of the contact zone displayed a significant preference for their own color pattern morph (e.g., blue females preferred blue males). Yet, intriguingly, they found that frogs from the contact zone showed a strong preference for the red morph, even if they were blue. This contradicts a key prediction that sexual selection is driving reproductive isolation and speciation in this system, and opens up questions of what is preventing the blue morph from being swamped by genes for the red morph, which is the common mainland pattern of O. pumilio. 
","
Tadpoles are obligately oophagous and must receive an egg meal within 3 days of being placed in a bromeliad water pool in order to survive.  Males have been observed eating the eggs or carrying the tadpoles of unattended clutches to bromeliad water pools where they will die since the female will not be able to feed them (Duellman and Trueb 1986).  

They metamorphose when they reach approximately 11 mm long (Walls 1994). 
","
It is generally common throughout its range.  Habitat loss and overcollection for the pet trade are problems for some populaions. Tourism (e.g., www.redfrogbeachclub.com) also affects some populations.  It is found within several protected areas, including the Finca La Selva Biological Reserve (Costa Rica) and Isla Bastimentos National Marine Park (Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama), and may occur within other protected areas, particularly in Costa Rica.  Export data from 1991-1996 showed that the majority of specimens (>95%) came from Nicaragua, which has established a CITES 2001 export quota of 3,450 specimens for O. pumilio (SolÃ­s et al. 2008).

 What happens when diverging subpopulations of more brightly colored members come into contact with less colorful ones? If preference is driven by either sexual selection, or natural selection, or both, we expect to see the two populations merge. Segami Marzal et al. (2017) ask whether an increased risk of predation acting directly on female preferences could counter this tendency, enhancing the probability of population divergence in Oophaga pumilio where populations of aposematic (bright) and cryptic (dull) morphs come into contact in Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama. Using photos of the frogs, they trained chickens to peck at cryptic frogs for a reward. Their subsequent experiments showed that cryptic frog morphs were more likely to be discovered and pecked when they occurred near a brightly colored, aposematic morph. Thus, females of a cryptic morph might suffer a higher risk of attack when approaching a brightly colored male; this could directly select against female preferences for such males and hence reduce interbreeding between morphs, ultimately enhancing the probability of population divergence and speciation.

This species was featured as News of the Week on 18 March 2019:
Monogamy in vertebrate evolution appears multiple times in separate lineages but their underlying genetic underpinnings are only recently explored.  Young et al. (2019) compared differential gene expression between the transcriptomes of monogamous and polygamous species in five sets of species pairs across vertebrates (mice, voles, birds, frogs and fish). The frog pair were poison frogs Ranitomeya imitator (monogamous) and Oophaga pumilio (polygamous). Tests for differential gene expression between each pair revealed that congruent sets of genes (orthologous or genes of the same evolutionary genealogy) showed concordant changes in expression between the monogamous and the polygamous lineages. The directions of changes in expression in these gene sets were also concordant, such that genes which decreased in expression in the monogamous lineage of one taxonomic pair were likely to decrease in expression in the other monogamous lineages as well (for all pairwise comparisons). However, the frog species were unique in that some genes displayed the opposite direction of change in expression relative to other monogamous lineages. The poison frogs are the only lineage here in which male parental care is ancestral so monogamy with biparental care in this lineage evolved from male care (rather than female care, as in the other taxa). Overall, their research yielded a novel set of 24 candidate genes likely to be involved in the evolution of monogamy, many of which are involved in neural development, synaptic activity and cognitive function. The study provides evidence for widely conserved sets of shared genes and molecular genetic pathways contributing to the evolution of monogamous mating systems across vast gulfs of evolutionary time and change in the vertebrate lineage (Written by Kyle Summers).

Poison dart frogs (Dendrobates pumilio) in the Bocas del Toro region of Panama have island populations which differ in coloration from the mainland, and a new experimental study by Yang et al (2019) shows that imprinting can account for the diversity in coloration on these different islands. Ingenious and demanding experiments demonstrated that female frogs with parents of the same color tended to choose mates of that color and would even do so in the case of foster parents. Similar results were obtained with respect to male-male aggression. Behavior plays a very important role in the lives of these frogs. The new results help understand the spectacular geographic patterns of color diversification in this sinking landscape and its island frogs (Written by David B. Wake).

Oophaga speciosa has a snout-vent length ranging from 28-31 mm. it is relatively large and has its inner tarsal fold reduced to a tubercle (Savage 1986). Its skin is smooth except for the posterior belly and the ventral surface of the thighs. The tympanum is round, with a diameter slightly greater than one half the diameter of the eye (Silverstone 1975). 
 Coloration: Its color in life is red. In preservative, it is entirely gray except for a few possible light spots (Silverstone 1975).

","
The Splendid Poison Frog hails from Panama, in a small geographic range found near the western Cordillera de Talamanca Central, adjacent to Costa Rica, at around 1370 m above sea level. It is mainly a terrestrial species that is found in the humid lowlands and very wet montane forest (Stuart et al. 2008).

 
","
Oophaga speciosa is diurnal.

This frog exhibits uniparental care. Females deposit eggs in leaf litter, and once the eggs hatch, the females carry the tadpoles to small accumulations of water, formed in the leaf/stem axils of plants. Females return to feed tadpoles with infertile eggs (Summers 1999).

 It is common for males to be very aggressive when defending territories for foraging and oviposition sites (Wells 2007).
 
","

","
IUCN Redlist has listed this species as extinct due to lack of any evidence of its persistence in its limited distribution since its last documented collection in 1992 by the pet trade. This species is highly visible and diurnal but despite extensive surveys it has not been seen in the wild. It occurred in a region known to have been part of a wave of chytridiomycosis Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) (IUCN 2020).


","
Its main threat is habitat loss from logging and human settlement, but it is negatively impacted by the pet trade. (Stuart et al. 2008).

Phyllobates aurotaenia adults reach a maximum snout-vent length of 32 mm in males and 35 mm in females. The skin is slightly granular on the dorsum and smooth on the ventrum and limbs.  The first finger is longer than the second, with all finger discs being narrow to moderately expanded. Toes are webless. Both maxillary and premaxillary teeth are present. Testes are unpigmented (Silverstone 1976).   
 
This species has a black ground color, with two thin golden, orange, or green dorsolateral stripes extending from the base of the thigh and meeting at the snout (Silverstone 1976; Myers et al. 1978). The dorsal surfaces of the limbs are covered in gold, orange, blue, or green dots, and the ventral surface is black with blue or green dots (Silverstone 1976). Dotting is relatively sparse on the venter and more concentrated on the limbs (Silverstone 1976). The stripes are green or light yellow, and the ventral dots are always blue on individuals from SerranÃ­a de BaudÃ³ (Silverstone 1976).  On individuals from the upper San Juan drainage, the stripes are yellow, light or dark yellow-orange, or light brownish gold (Silverstone 1976). There is a second form; some individuals, from above the Playa de Oro on the upper Rio San Juan, are larger and have broader dorsolateral stripes that are sometimes blended together by an orangish dorsal suffusion into one yellow-orange or red-orange stripe (Silverstone 1976; Myers et al. 1978).  

Phyllobates aurotaenia juveniles are black with golden dorsolateral stripes, like P. terribilis juveniles.  However, young P. aurotaenia have blue or green ventral spotting, which is not present in P. terribilis (Myers et al. 1978).
","
Phyllobates aurotaenia is found in the ChocÃ³ region of Colombia in the Atrato and San Juan drainages (Silverstone 1976).  It lives in low-elevation inland rainforest at an altitude of 60 to 520 meters, west of the Cordillera Occidental (Silverstone 1976; Myers et al. 1978). 
","
Phyllobates are usually diurnal species due to the advantage of greater visibility of their color markings, which warn predators that they possess skin toxins (Silverstone 1976). This species secretes skin batrachotoxins when under stress (Silverstone 1976; Myers et al. 1978). However, this species is secretive and can be hard to find even in areas where there are dense populations (Myers et al. 1978).   
 
 
Calls are usually made from a concealed location under fallen leaves or logs, but occasionally while sitting on fallen leaves (Silverstone 1976).  The call has been described as a ""loud, bird-like, whirring twitter, consisting of rapidly repeating notes"" (Silverstone 1976), with a duration of 4-11 seconds (Silverstone 1976).  This call is repeated after intervals lasting from several seconds up to 45 seconds (Silverstone 1976).  The dominant frequency is higher than 2000 Hz (Myers et al. 1978).
","
Tadpoles of all Phyllobates species, including P. aurotaenia, have an emarginate, ""normal"" oral disc (meaning the oral disc is not umbelliform).  The larval vent tube is dextral (Grant et al. 2006).
","
This species does not occur in any protected areas and is rapidly losing its habitat.
","
Phyllobates aurotaenia is one of only three species of frogs (P. aurotaenia, P. bicolor, P. terribilis) known to be used for poisoning darts (Myers et al. 1978).  Various ChocÃ³ tribes in western Colombia have used these frogs to poison darts for dart-guns.  The frogs primarily secrete the steroidal alkaloids batrachotoxin, homobatrachotoxin, and batrachotoxinin A, which cause depolarization of nerves and muscles, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure if taken internally and skin numbness when encountered externally.  To extract the poison, the ChocÃ³ impale P. aurotaenia and P. bicolor lengthwise on sticks, and may also heat the spitted frogs to increase the amount of skin secretions; darts are then rubbed against the skin of the impaled frog.  This is in contrast to the treatment of P. terribilis which has much higher levels of skin toxins; for this species, darts are simply rubbed across the back of the live frog (Myers et al. 1978).  

Per frog, the larger P. terribilis have about 27x the amount of batrachotoxin-homobatrachotoxin as the smaller P. aurotaenia.  When normalized for skin weight, P. terribilis has about nine times the amount of batrachotoxin-homobatrachotoxin in the same amount of skin (100 mg) as P. aurotaenia.  For batrachotoxinin A, P. terribilis has 4x the amount of toxin per frog as the smaller P. aurotaenia, or 1.3x as much toxin by equivalent skin weight.  The third species of frog used for poisoning darts, P. bicolor, seems to be roughly equivalent in toxicity to P. aurotaenia (Myers et al. 1978).

The ChocÃ³ name for P. aurotaenia, kÃ¶koÃ©, is pronounced ""kohng-KWAY"" (Silverstone 1976).
","
There are two forms of Phyllobates aurotaenia, a narrow-striped, slightly smaller form, and a broad-striped, slightly larger form, which do not always occur in the same place (Silverstone 1976).  In the western Atrato drainage, the broad-striped form is absent and the narrow-striped form occurs up to at least 500 m (Silverstone 1976). In the Playa de Oro, it is not clear whether the narrow-striped form occurs at lower elevation than the broad-striped form; the two forms may simply be separated by a deep ravine (Quebrada BochoramÃ¡) and not by elevation (Silverstone 1976).

Myers et al. (1978) speculates that there may be a cline between P. aurotaenia and P. bicolor, or hybridization, in the upper San Juan drainage.  The largest specimens, which have the broad, fused dorsal stripes, come from above Playa de Oro on the upper Rio San Juan; these individuals more closely resemble P. bicolor in both coloration and size (Silverstone 1976; Myers et al. 1978).  Phyllobates bicolor has a uniformly colored orange (red-orange, orange, or yellow-orange) dorsum lacking stripes. Phyllobates bicolor is also slightly larger (38.2 mm average size) than the broad-striped form of P. aurotaenia (32.1 mm average size), which is in turn larger than the narrow-striped form (26.3 mm average size).

Silverstone (1976) comments that the narrow-striped form more closely resembles P. lugubris and P. vittatus, but is separated from them by a distributional gap in Panama.

Phyllobates bicolor is a small frog, with males reaching an adult size of 32.1-39.5 mm and females reaching 35.7-42.7 mm (Myers et al. 1978). The skin is smooth (Silverstone 1976).  Both premaxillary and maxillary teeth are present (Silverstone 1976). The first finger is longer than the second, and the digits have expanded discs (Silverstone 1976). Toes lack webbing (Silverstone 1976).  
Phyllobates bicolor color patterning is very striking. The dorsum and sides are a uniform golden yellow or orange, as well as the dorsal surfaces of the upper arm and thigh (Myers et al. 1978). In contrast, the dorsal surfaces of the forearm and calf are black, and may or may not have dense yellow (or sometimes blue) spotting (Myers et al. 1978).  The ventrum may be completely black, or washed with light orange, light gold, or bluish green (Myers et al. 1978).  There is occasionally a black patch on the throat (Silverstone 1976).  The tympanum is partly yellow-orange and partly black (Silverstone 1976).  In some individuals, the tip of the snout is black (Silverstone 1976).  Irises are black or reddish-brown (Silverstone 1976).  
 
This species, like P. terribilis, exhibits an ontogenetic color change; juveniles are dark brown to black in color, with two yellowish dorsolateral bands.  As the frogs reach maturity, the dorsolateral stripes disappear, and the frogs become more brightly colored. In contrast, the juvenile pattern of light stripes on a dark background is retained into adulthood in other members of the P. bicolor group, P. aurotaenia, P. lugubris and P. vittatus (Myers et al. 1978; Silverstone 1976). 

Phyllobates bicolor closely resembles P. terribilis, but P. bicolor is smaller in size and has legs and venter of a different hue than the body color (Myers et al. 1978). 
","
The Black Leg Poison Dart Frog lives in the tropical rain forests of Colombia, on the western side of the northern part of the Cordillera Occidental, between 25-1,525 m above sea level. It occurs in the upper Atrato and San Juan drainages, the RÃ­o Raposo, and headwaters of the RÃ­o SipÃ­, in the Cordillera Occidental. This species inhabits the forest floor (Silverstone 1976; Myers et al. 1978). It is reported to survive in logged forest but not open habitat (IUCN 2006).

 

","
Like other dendrobatids, Phyllobates bicolor are diurnal and are very active. Little has been published on the reproductive behavior of this species in the wild. Zimmermann (1989) has published sonograms of P. bicolor calls, and reports that in captivity, P. bicolor, males initiate courtship by giving a ""long-range"" courtship call.  The female then follows the male to a covered egg deposition site. Once the female approaches within 8 cm, the male emits a ""short-range"" courtship croak call, ceasing before the female oviposits. Circling and body-anal touching was observed but not amplexus. In captivity, a single female may lay up to three clutches of 12-20 eggs per month. The male moistens the clutch at irregular intervals (hydric brooding).  Tadpoles hatch in about 14 days, after which the male transports them to a water-filled brooding site (Zimmermann 1989).   
 

","

","
It occurs in one protected area, the Parque Nacional Natural Farallones de Cali. Major threats include habitat alteration due to deforestation for agriculture and logging, and human settlement; pollution from spraying illegal crops; and introduction of non-native predatory fish. Collection for the international pet trade occurs but it is difficult to assess the extent of this threat. Chytridiomycosis may be a potential future threat (IUCN 2006).  
 

","
Phyllobates bicolor is one of only three species of frog (P. terribilis, P. aurotaenia, and P. bicolor) that have been documented as used by humans to poison darts. All are from the Pacific versant of Colombia, and used by various tribes of the ChocÃ³ Indians in western Colombia.  All three species have high levels of batrachotoxins, with P. terribilis by far the most toxic and the other two species approximately equal in toxicity to each other. Phyllobates terribilis contains 700-1900 micrograms of batrachotoxin-homobatrachotoxin per frog, whereas P. bicolor contains 17-56 micrograms of combined toxins per frog.  Batrachotoxin-containing skin secretions for poisoning dart tips are obtained either by simply rubbing the tip on the live frog's back (P. terribilis), or impaling the frog and also sometimes heating it (P. bicolor and P. aurotaenia) (Myers et al. 1978).


 

","
As is true of other species in the genus Phyllobates, this species produces batrachotoxins.  However, captive-born and bred dendrobatid frogs lack toxicity, since the toxins are acquired at least in part from dietary sources such as ants, mites or beetles (Daly et al. 1980; Daly et al. 1992; Dumbacher et al. 2004). In contrast, the toxins persist in wild-caught animals even when they are maintained in captivity (Daly et al. 1978).

Myers et al. (1978) have speculated that there might be either hybridization or a cline between P. bicolor and P. aurotaenia in the upper San Juan drainage, due to the intermediate size and coloration of the Phyllobates found there.

Phyllobates lugubris is a small frog (adult males reach 21 mm in SVL, while adult females can reach 24 mm). The skin is slightly granular on the dorsum, the dorsal surface of the limbs, the belly, and the ventral surface of the thighs.  Skin is smooth on the ventrum and ventral surface of the limbs.  The head is longer than wide, with a rounded and truncate snout.  Both maxillary and premaxillary teeth are present. The first finger is longer than the second and the toes are webless.  A weak tarsal fold or tubercle is present.  An elongated inner metatarsal tubercle is present, as is a rounded and smaller outer metatarsal tubercle (Savage 2002; Silverstone 1976; Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Males have a thick, dark nuptial pad along the inside of each thumb, and thicker forearms than the females (Leenders 2001; Guyer and Donnelly 2005).   

This frog has a jet black dorsum, with wide, paired dorsolateral stripes that can either yellow, orange, gold, or turquoise.  There is also a thinner, lighter  turquoise or white ventrolateral stripe, running on each side from the tip of the snout below the eye, along the upper lips and to the arm. On the upper surfaces of the limbs, there is marbling with black and gold to yellowish green.  The lower surfaces of the limbs, and the venter, are marbled with black and blue, green, white, or silver.   This species has large eyes with jet black or dark brown irises. The eye is difficult to distinguish against the dark color of the head (Savage 2002; Silverstone 1976; Guyer and Donnelly 2005).      

","
Phyllobates lugubris occurs in the Caribbean lowlands, from the extreme southeastern tip of Nicaragua through Costa Rica and into northwestern Panama, including on the islands of the Bocas del Toros archipelago in Panama  
(Leenders 2001; Savage 2002). This species is found from sea level to 650 m (IUCN 2004).  It prefers lowland wet and moist forests, but also occurs at the margin of premontane wet forests (Savage 2002). It has been found in leaf litter in both primary and secondary forests in La Selva, Costa Rica, preferring to live near slow-moving waters (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).
","
Phyllobates lugubris is diurnal, inhabiting leaf litter on the forest floor (Savage, 2002).  The bright coloration is aposematic, serving as a warning of skin toxins to predators. This frog is not territorial  
(Savage 2002). 

Breeding occurs during the wet season.  Males usually call from within protected areas of low visibility, such as water surrounded by thick vegetation, to attract females (Leenders 2001). The call is a constant high trill, composed of squalls and chortles that last several seconds, and sounds similar to rubbing a hand across an inflated balloon (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Savage (2002) states that Silverstone's (1976) description of the call of P. lugubris as a low raspy trill is in error, and that the call described by Silverstone is actually that of the related species Phyllobates vittatus. The male and female work together to create a ground nest in dry leaf litter (Savage 2002; Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  The female then deposits her eggs, which the male fertilizes (Savage 2002; Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Development from oviposition to hatching takes nine to fourteen days (Savage 2002).   
 
This species exhibits uniparental male care (Weygoldt 1987; Zimmermann and Zimmermann 1988). After the female deposits the eggs in a ground nest, they are periodically moistened by the male parent (hydric brooding)
(Savage 2002; Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  Once the eggs are hatched, the male transports his offspring to aquatic rearing sites by carrying five to ten tadpoles at a time on his back (Donnelly et al. 1990; Caldwell et al. 1994). In about two months they metamorphose into froglets of about 12 mm (Savage 2002).  Frogs are sexually mature at about 10 months  
(Savage 2002).  The adult diet consists of a wide variety of invertebrate prey, most of which are insects such as formicids (ants) and areneids (Lieberman 1986; Guyer and Donnelly 2005).

Phyllobates lugubris tadpoles are small, reaching 24 mm in total length.  Tail length is 58% of the total tadpole length.  The tadpole has a depressed body, and tail height does not increase relative to increasing total length as the tadpole grows. The snout is rounded, with lateral nostrils. Eyes are dorsolateral.  The mouth is directed ventrally, with a small and emarginate oral disc and serrated beaks. There are 2/3 rows of denticles, with a gap above the mouth at the median of the A2 denticle row.  Papillae are present in a single large row as well as in two rows laterally under the mouth, but are not continuous above the mouth.  As development progresses, the number of rows of papillae on the oral disc increases. In the early stages of development, the vent is medial and the spiracle is located at the mid-body, while in later stages, the vent is twisted right-clockwise and the spiracle is sinistral (on the left side of the body). The body and caudal musculature are dark brown, shading to a lighter brown ventrally.  The fins are transparent with brown spots  (Savage 2002; Donnelly 1990).

Habitat loss is due mainly to deforestation and human-induced water pollution.  This species shows tolerance to a degree of habitat modification, and is found in three protected areas in Panama and three in Costa Rica. Some collected specimens have been found to be infected with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (chytrid fungus), but the pathogenic impacts are unclear (IUCN, 2004).

Striped Poison Dart Frogs have become popular pets and are collected for the pet trade.  Some South American cultures capture other members of this genus  (Phyllobates terribilis, P. bicolor, P. aurotaenia) to  poison blow-gun darts (Myers et al. 1978). However, Phyllobates lugubris is not as toxic as other species in its genus and has not been documented to have been hunted primarily for its poison (Myers et al. 1978; Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Some populations do contain batrachotoxins in the skin, but a few populations of Phyllobates lugubris have been found to contain no detectable amounts of toxin (Daly 1995). If toxins are present in wild-caught dendrobatid frogs, they persist even when the frogs are maintained in captivity (Daly et al. 1978).  However, captive-born and bred dendrobatid frogs lack toxicity, since the toxins are acquired from dietary sources such as ants, mites or beetles (Daly et al. 1980; Daly et al. 1992; Dumbacher et al. 2004). 
","
The genus Phyllobates is known to produce batrachotoxins in the skin, which can cause heart failure in predators that eat these frogs (Myers et al. 1978). These toxins are some of the most poisonous small molecules known and owe their effects to the irreversible interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in membrane depolarization (Daly 1980).  However, in Phyllobates lugubris, the amount of toxin is relatively low, ranging from none to 0.8 micrograms per frog (Daly 1980).  

Phyllobates lugubris is sympatric with another species, Eleutherodactylus gaigeae, known as the ""false poison-dart frog.""  This species mimics the appearance of P. lugubris in order to fend off predators, by having two paired red stripes running the length of the body.  However, E. gaigae is a non-toxic mimic and does not produce batrachotoxins (Leenders 2001).

Phyllobates terribilis is a small frog (although large for a dendrobatid), with adult females having a maximum snout-vent length of 47 mm, and adult males reaching 45 mm in snout-vent length.  Males mature at 37 mm while females mature at 40-41 mm. The snout is sloping and rounded in lateral profile, and bluntly rounded to truncate in dorsal view.  The canthus rostralis is rounded, and the loreal region is both vertical and slightly concave. The tympanum is concealed posterodorsally. Hands and feet lack webbing and fringe. Fingers and toes terminate in moderately expanded discs; the disc of the third finger is expanded to the same degree in both males and females. If measured while appressed, the third finger is longest with the fourth, first, and second following in decreasing or approximately equal length; if measured from the base, the third finger is longest and the first finger is next while fingers 2 and 4 are roughly equal. Hands have a large, low, rounded tubercle on the palm. An inner metacarpal tubercle is present on the base of the first finger, with one subarticular tubercle on each of fingers 1 and 2, and two subarticular tubercles on fingers 3 and 4.  On the feet, the relative length of the toes is 4>3>5>2>1. The distal third of the tarsus is ridged, with the ridge continuous from the inner metarsal tubercle to the tarsal tubercle. Toes 1 and 2 each bear one subarticular tubercle, toes 3 and 5 have two subarticular tubercles, and toe 4 bears three subarticular tubercles.  Phyllobates terribilis skin is smooth to somewhat rugose or finely granular, becoming noticeably rugose and coarsely granular on the upper hind limbs. Teeth are present on the maxillary arch. Males have a shallow subgular vocal sac that is indicated by small expansion wrinkles at the base of the throat, and well-developed paired vocal slits on the floor of the mouth (Myers et al. 1978).   
 
The dorsal coloration on adult specimens of Phyllobates terribilis is bright golden yellow or golden orange, or pale metallic green, depending on the location of collection.  Occasional individuals were deep orange or pale greenish yellow.  Ventrally the color is the same as or slightly lighter than the dorsal color, except for the underside of the hands and feet, which are black, and the undersides of the thighs, which have a black seat patch.  There is also a black crease at the axilla and groin. The eyes, nares and digit tips are black. There is usually black edging on the lower rim of the tympanum.  In many individuals the mouth is edged with black, and the creases of limb articulations are often black. Males generally have some gray coloration on the base of the throat. In some individuals there is also a light gray suffusing the axilla and groin, as well as the posterior of the venter and the concealed part of the shank.  In individuals that are pale metallic green in overall color, the venter may be slightly bluish green and the concealed part of the shank is sometimes a definite blue-green. Variation in ground color hue was associated with microgeographic variation (i.e. frogs collected from a given ridge or slope area tended to be the same hue) (Myers et al. 1978). 
 
Phyllobates terribilis tadpoles measure an average of 4.1 mm in body length and 11.1 mm in total length at hatching.  At stage 37 (with well-developed hind legs), tadpoles have reached an average size of 12.6 mm in body length and 35.4 mm in total length. The head and body are depressed, with body width being greater than body depth.  Eyes and nostrils are dorsal, and the eyes are directed dorsolaterally.  The spiracle is sinistral and the vent is dextral (in some stage 25 larvae, the vent was located medially).  The mouth is anteroventral with finely serrated beaks and 2/3 tooth formula; the second row of teeth above the mouth has a gap above the beak.  The oral disc is anteriorly nude and indented laterally, with the lateral and posterior edges of the disc having one or two rows of papillae, depending on the developmental stage of the larva.  Mouthparts are incompletely developed at stage 25 (the stage at which many dendrobatid tadpoles mount onto the back of the attendant parent frog).  At stage 25 the denticles begin to keratinize and beak serrations are only just beginning to develop.  Stage 25 larvae have a single row of papillae while stage 27 and older larvae have two rows (similar to the ontogenetic changes seen in tadpole oral papillae of some hylid frogs) (Myers et al. 1978). 
 
Newly hatched tadpoles are gray on the bodies and throats with paler gray tails and tail fins, with tiny flecks on the body and tail.  At stage 26 the tail fins begin to become essentially transparent; there is weak pigmentation along the base of the fins and sparse flecking. At stage 37 the body color changes to blackish gray. Dense flecks are present dorsally and concentrate into paired dorsolateral stripes that run from the snout over the eyes to the base of the tail.  To the naked eye the dorsolateral stripes look gray on a grayish black body, but under magnification the stripes appear pale bronze.  At stage 42 (when forelimbs appear) the body is black and the dorsolateral stripes are brighter bronze to bronze-gold 
(Myers et al. 1978). 
 
Juvenile frogs are black in color, with gold dorsolateral stripes. This species undergoes an ontogenetic color change. As the frogs reach maturity, the dorsolateral stripes disappear, and the body becomes a more brightly colored uniform golden yellow.   The bright golden dorsal coloration is achieved by 18 weeks, when the frog is about 21 mm in SVL, with the venter taking another several weeks to reach the same bright color.  Since the frog reaches adult size in somewhat more than a year, the adult coloration is actually attained fairly early.  Juvenile P. terribilis resemble P. aurotaenia in that both are black with paired gold dorsolateral stripes.  However, juvenile P. terribilis can be distinguished by the lack of blue or green ventral spotting (present in juvenile P. aurotaenia) (Myers et al. 1978).  The juvenile pattern of light stripes on a dark background is also lost in P. bicolor upon reaching maturity, but is retained into adulthood in the other members of the P. bicolor group, P. aurotaenia, P. lugubris and P. vittatus (Myers et al. 1978; Silverstone 1976).

","
Golden Poison Frogs can be found in the western foothills of the Andes on a â€œnortherly inclined spur of the Cordillera Occidentalâ€ in Pacific coastal Colombia. The terrain is rough and hilly, with mostly steep, even perpendicular slopes.  Elevation in their range varies from 90-200 m above sea level.  They live in rainforest, occurring throughout the forest both on drier ridge tops and on moister slopes. They tend to live near smaller streams since forest along the larger streams has either been cleared for agriculture or is dense secondary growth forest (Myers et al. 1978).
","
This species, like all other members of the family Dendrobatidae, is diurnal. It is also terrestrial, preferring to sit on the ground or perched only a few centimeters above the ground on tree roots or ground litter.  They are noticeably bolder than other poison dart frogs and are found out in the open.  When disturbed, they will usually only hop away rather than try and hide.  While these frogs normally are solitary in the wild, they have been occasionally observed in pairs.   

Their calls are long sustained trills, consisting of a rapid succession of individual notes uttered at a rate of 13 per second, with a dominant frequency of 1.8 kHz. This frequency is lower than that of P. aurotaenia, P. bicolor, P.lugubris and P. vittatus (Myers et al. 1978).   
 
Eggs are laid terrestrially in small clutches of less than 20.  Larvae, at developmental stage 25, are transported to pools on the backs of the male frogs.  Male frogs have been observed carrying up to nine larvae simultaneously (Myers et al. 1978).
 
The populations appear to be large and dispersed through the forest, with both adults and juveniles found on the forest floor, although juveniles appear to be relatively rare (2.5% of all specimens collected).  Recruitment appears to be low since clutch size is small and few nurse frogs were observed carrying tadpoles, yet P. terribilis adults were fairly abundant at the type locality. This species takes more than a year to attain sexual maturity and is relatively long-lived (five years in captivity) (Myers et al. 1978). 
 
Given its toxicity, Phyllobates terribilis seems likely to have few predators other than the snake Leimadophis epinephelus.  This snake has a high resistance to various anuran toxins (zetekitoxin from Atelopus zeteki, atelopid toxins from Atelopus elegans, piperidine alkaloids from Dendrobates auratus, and batrachotoxins from Phyllobates sp.).  It is not a large snake (500 mm in total length); since adult Phyllobates terribilis frogs are fairly stocky and quite toxic, these snakes may only consume the juvenile P. terribilis and not the adults (Myers et al. 1978). 
 
 
During feeding in captivity, frogs may clasp each other around the head (cephalic clasping) or sometimes the body.  Interestingly, Phyllobates terribilis males have been observed in captive aggressive behavior to press the upper surfaces of their hands against their opponent's chin (rather than grasping the other frog's head with the palms contacting the head) 
(Myers et al. 1978).
","

","
This species avoids secondary growth and cultivated areas, and prefers primary growth forest, making it sensitive to human land use. It is not prevalent along larger streams in its range, due to development in the form of plantain fields, or secondary growth from previous forest resource utilization. Major threats include pollution from illegal spraying of crops, and deforestation (Myers et al. 1978).
","
Phyllobates terribilis is the most highly toxic of all frogs, and is one of three species known to be used by native Colombians such as the ChocÃ³ and CofÃ¡n to poison their blow-gun darts (the other species being P. aurotaenia and P. bicolor). Once P. terribilis has been captured, the darts are rubbed over the skin of the live frog to collect the poison (in contrast to the other two Phyllobates species which are impaled on sticks and sometimes heated, to maximize the amount of toxic secretions). The poisoned darts are then used for hunting (Myers et al. 1978).
","
This species produces the steroidal alkaloids batrachotoxin, homobatrachotoxin, and batrachotoxinin A.  These compounds are extremely potent modulators of voltage-gated sodium channels, acting to keep the channels open and depolarizing nerve and muscle cells irreversibly, potentially leading to arrhythmias, fibrillation, and eventually cardiac failure  
(Albuquerque and Daly 1977).  When accidentally transferred onto human facial skin, these toxins have been reported to cause a burning sensation lasting several hours (Myers et al. 1978). 
 
Batrachotoxin by itself is also capable of inducing numbness (see below for Myers' 1978 description of the effect of tasting P. vittatus), through its profound effects on a specific voltage-gated sodium channel (Na 1.8) known to be involved in pain reception. Thus batrachotoxin might be useful to develop as a topical pain-relief medication (Bosmans et al. 2004). 
 
The combination of batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin is produced in quantities up to 1900 micrograms per frog, which is at least 20-fold more than other toxic species in the family Dendrobatidae. The range of batrachotoxin-homobatrachotoxin produced by individual frogs was 700-1900 micrograms, with an average of 1100 micrograms per frog. The lethal dose of batrachotoxin-homobatrachotoxin for a 20 gram white laboratory mouse is .05 micrograms when injected subcutaneously.  Thus one P. terribilis frog skin contains enough toxin to kill about 22,000 mice. The lethal dose of batrachotoxin for humans is not known but has been estimated at 200 micrograms, with a single frog thus potentially holding enough poison to kill about 10 humans.  Wild-caught frogs that had been held in captivity for periods ranging from three weeks up to one year had toxicities of about 50% of recently caught specimens, with frogs maintained in captivity for three years still maintaining toxicity at about 40% the level of recently captured animals (Myers et al. 1978).  In contrast, poison frogs born and reared in captivity do not contain toxins in their skin, although they can accumulate alkaloid toxins if these are part of the diet (Daly et al. 2004).     
 
Tadpoles did not contain batrachotoxin but a juvenile of 27 mm SVL was found to contain 200 micrograms of toxin, implying that the batrachotoxin alkaloids are synthesized or sequestered after metamorphosis (Myers et al. 1978).  The toxins are concentrated in granular glands, which are most dense on the dorsal skin surfaces of the frog (Dumbacher et al. 2000). 
 
In contrast, the related species P. bicolor is much less toxic, containing from 17-56 micrograms of batrachotoxin-homobatrachotoxin per frog, with an average of 47 micrograms per individual.  Despite P. bicolor being more brightly colored, larger, and more openly active than P. aurotaenia, the two species are thought to be roughly the same in toxicity levels (Myers et al. 1978).  The more distantly related Central American species Phyllobates vittatus and P. lugubris also produce batrachotoxins but at much lower quantities.  Despite these lower levels of toxin, Myers et al. (1978) reported that tasting the back of P. vittatus gave the human taster a sensation of near-numbness of the tongue, followed by a distinctly unpleasant tightening in the throat.  
 
Interestingly, batrachotoxins have also been found in feathers, but not the skin, of multiple species of passerine birds from New Guinea (particularly Pitohui dichrous, P. kirhocephalus, and Ifrita kowaldi) (Dumbacher et al. 2000).  Breast, belly, and leg feathers show the highest toxin concentrations. Both toxin levels and toxin profiles in these birds vary considerably from population to population and can also change seasonally, implying that these toxins are acquired or synthesized from an environmental (dietary) source (Dumbacher et al. 2000). This source is most likely beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain batrachotoxins and have been found in the stomach contents of New Guinea's toxic passerine birds.  The family Melyridae is cosmopolitan and thus beetles could potentially be the source of the Phyllobates toxin as well (Dumbacher et al. 2004). Dietary arthropods (formicine ants, myrmecine ants, and in Madagascar, ponerine ants, as well as the siphonotid millipede Rhinotus purpureus) are known to provide defensive alkaloids to other toxic dendrobatid and mantellid frogs (Clark et al. 2005).
 
This species was featured as News of the Week on 27 September 2021: 
What do Pitohui birds and Phyllobates poison frogs have in common? They both sequester the potent neurotoxin called batrachotoxin â€“ and presumably resist its lethal effects. Batrachotoxin binds to voltage-gated sodium channels, a group of proteins that are partly responsible for action potentials, and thus interrupt the nervous system functions. Previous studies have predicted that the voltage-gated sodium channels from Phyllobates poison frogs possess changes in the amino acid sequence that prevent batrachotoxin from bindingâ€“ yet Abderemane-Ali et al. (2021) find that batrachotoxin readily binds to poison frog and pitohui sodium channels, suggesting that these animals have a different mechanism of toxin resistance. They propose that circulating ""toxin sponges"" could bind to batrachotoxin, preventing it from binding to the voltage-gated sodium channels. Although a batrachotoxin-binding protein remains elusive, a unique toxin-binding protein called saxiphilin (which binds saxitoxin, the toxin underlying red tides) was discovered in bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in the 1990s, suggesting that toxin sponges may be a common way for frogs to counter the potential lethal effects of toxin accumulation. Perhaps even more intriguing is the potential for ""toxin sponges"" to allow toxin sequestration and resistance to evolve in parallel (Marquez 2021, Abderemane-Ali et al 2021).

Phyllobates vittatus is a small frog, with males reaching 26 mm in SVL and females measuring up to 31 mm in SVL  
(Leenders 2001).  The skin on the dorsal surfaces is slightly granular or shagreened, with tiny bumps  
(Silverstone, 1976).  Skin is also slightly granular on the belly and the ventral surfaces of the thighs, but smooth on the rest of the ventral surfaces (Silverstone 1976). Both maxillary and premaxillary teeth are present (Silverstone 1976).  Finger I is longer than finger II.  The toes lack webbing (Silverstone 1976).  

The back and head are generally solid black, although in some individuals there is an interrupted yellow median dorsal stripe.  A wide gold, red-orange or orange dorsolateral stripe runs from each side of the snout over the eyes and back, down to the base of the thigh.  A single white line projects from the shoulder, at the insertion of the upper arm, and runs along the lip to just under the eye. The dorsal surfaces of the limbs show dense blue-green speckling on a black background, while the venter and ventral surfaces of the limbs are marbled with white or pale blue-green on black.   Each flank has a white or pale blue-green stripe running ventrolaterally 
 (Silverstone 1976).  
 
The tadpole coloration is uniformly dark brown on the dorsal side of the body, tail, and fins, with the venter being a lighter brown  
(Savage 2002).  Tadpoles develop the paired bright-orange stripes characteristic of the adults about two months after hatching, near the time of metamorphosis  
(Leenders 2001).  Larvae reach 30 mm in total length  
(Savage 2002).  The body is depressed  
(Savage 2002). Nostrils and eyes are located dorsally, while the mouth is ventral  
(Savage 2002).  The oral disc is small and emarginate, with serrated beaks and 2/3 rows of denticles; the row of denticles just above the beaks shows a gap in the middle  
(Savage 2002).  Papillae are present both above and below the mouth but those above the mouth are not continuous  
(Savage 2002).  
","
The Golfo Dulce Poison-Dart Frog is endemic to Costa Rica, inhabiting the wet forests and lowlands of the Golfo Dulce region in the southwestern part of Costa Rica 
 (Silverstone 1976; Leenders 2001). It has also been reported to occur near Dominical, in the province of Puntarentas, Costa Rica (Ryan 2002). This species is found between 20 to 550 meters in elevation  
(Savage 2002). It prefers the leaf litter of forested valleys with streams  
(Leenders 2001). 

","
Phyllobates vittatus is a diurnal and terrestrial species (Savage 2002).  This species is reasonably common  
(Savage 2002). It is shy and will hide in rock crevices or holes between tree roots when approached  
(Leenders 2001).  Locomotion is by walking interspersed with rapid hops 
 (Savage 2002).  Males are thought not to be territorial (Savage 2002), but intraspecific aggressive behavior has been reported in captivity with one frog jumping on the back of the other and pressing down (Polder 1976). The advertisement call, which males use to try to attract females to oviposition sites, consists of a low-pitched, raspy trill lasting two to six seconds  
(Savage 2002).  There is also a second type of call, produced during active pair courtship  
(Travis, pers. comm., cited in Silverstone 1976).  The courtship call consists of a series of two to five high-pitched chirps dropping successively in pitch, followed by another series after a pause  
(Silverstone 1976; Savage 2002).  This call is used when the female is near or pursuing the male (Silverstone 1976). 

In captivity the breeding season lasts three months (Savage 2002).  The male chooses the egg deposition site (in captivity, preferentially on a bromeliad leaf, occasionally on a fern leaf, and rarely on the terrarium floor) and calls to attract a female (Silverstone 1976).  Courtship occurs before oviposition, with courtship behavior lasting from one to seven days prior, and including calling, circling, shaking of the limbs, jumping on and sitting on the courting partner (either sex), and pursuit of the male by the female (Silverstone 1976).  There is no amplexus in this species; the sexes have been reported to place vents in contact (Savage 2002).      

During the breeding season the female lays clutches every week or two (Savage 2002). Each clutch in captivity contains 7 to 21 eggs, usually deposited on leaves above the ground 
(Silverstone 1976). This species has parental care, with the male parent attending the clutch up to three times a day and engaging in hydric brooding (emptying the bladder on the eggs to keep them moist)  
(Savage 2002).  In captivity, it has been observed that the first two visits occur on the day of oviposition, once immediately after oviposition for 5-65 minutes (to fertilized the eggs), and after an interval of half an hour, the male sits on the eggs again for 60-90 minutes (Travis, pers. comm., cited in Silverstone 1976). The male does not visit over the next seven days.  In the second week, the male visits the eggs once a day for five minutes or so, and in the third week, he visits the eggs 1-3x a day.  

A few days to a week after the eggs hatch (which occurs in thirteen to seventeen days), the male will allow some or all of his tadpoles to crawl up on his back  
(Savage 2002).  In captivity, the male has been observed to sit on the egg jelly and stamp his feet, after which the larvae wriggle onto his back (Polder 1976). Travis (pers. comm. cited in Silverstone 1976) also reported that the male shook his posterior in short bursts of four to five shakes to stimulate the larvae to crawl onto his back, with the process of tadpole uptake lasting about ten minutes. He then transports from one to thirteen larvae at a time, carrying them for 1-2 days, to a water source; in the wild, this consists of a small forest-floor puddle, or water in a fallen palm frond, or a tree-hole 
(Starrett, pers. comm., cited in Silverstone 1976; Travis, pers. comm., cited in Silverstone 1976; Savage 2002). Conspecific tadpoles are not aggressive towards siblings (Polder 1976). 

In about forty-five days the larvae metamorphose into small froglets of about 13 mm  
(Savage 2002).  Froglets are sexually mature at about ten months  
(Savage 2002).  The adult diet consists primarily of arthropods, particularly ants and occasionally coleopterans, dipterans, and collembolans 
(Savage 2002; Silverstone 1976). 

","

","
Habitat fragmentation from forest clearing and tree plantations seem to be the major threats. Water contamination from mining and collection of adults for the pet trade are also reasons for population decline (IUCN 2006).

Golfo Dulce Poison-Dart Frogs are used as pets; they are easy to breed, easy to keep, and are very colorful. Captive-born and bred dendrobatid frogs lack toxicity (Myers et al. 1978; Daly et al. 1980; Daly et al. 1992).  However, batrachotoxins persist in wild-caught Phyllobates even when they are maintained in captivity (Daly et al. 1978).
","
Phyllobates vittatus secretes batrachotoxins, which are lipophilic alkaloids that act as extremely potent cardiotoxins (Myers et al. 1978).  Batrachotoxins bind to voltage-gated sodium channels and force them to remain open, with the resulting influx of sodium ions causing irreversible depolarization of nerve and muscle cells. This in turn leads to arrhythmias, fibrillation and eventually cardiac failure (Albuquerque and Daly 1977). These compounds are known to be secreted in high quantitities in several South American Phyllobates (P. terribilis, P. bicolor and P. aurotaenia), and in low quantities in the Central American Phyllobates vittatus and P. lugubris (Myers et al. 1978). The South American Phyllobates have all been documented to be used to poison darts, unlike the Central American Phyllobates (P. vittatus and P. lugubris), which are far less toxic (Myers et al. 1978).  

Like other dendrobatid frogs, Phyllobates species are thought to acquire their toxins from dietary sources (Daly et al. 1980; Daly et al. 1992; Dumbacher et al. 2004).  One source for batrachotoxin may be melyrid beetles, which have been shown to contain high levels of this toxin (Dumbacher et al. 2004).  Melyrid beetles may also be the dietary source for batrachotoxin in the toxic New Guinea passerine bird genera Pitohui and Ifrita (Dumbacher et al. 2004).  

Despite the fact that P. vittatus contains small quantities of batrachotoxins when compared to the far more toxic South American Phyllobates terribilis, P. bicolor, and P.aurotaenia, Myers et al. (1978) report that tasting a wild-caught P. vittatus resulted in a ""lingering, almost numb sensation on the tongue, followed by a disagreeable tightening sensation in the throat"".  A captive snake (Rhadinaea taeniata aemula, from Mexico, which presumably had never encountered frogs with batrachotoxins) exhibited considerable distress for some hours after seizing and releasing a P. vittatus (Myers et al. 1978).  Initially the snake gaped and attempted to rub its mouth on the substrate; half an hour later the snake was also slowly contorting its body, as well as expanding its thorax, after which it laid motionless for four hours (Myers et al. 1978).  Recovery was complete by the next morning (Myers et al. 1978).

Ranitomeya imitator is a small frog, with adults ranging from 17 to 22 mm (Symula et al. 2001). Dorsal skin is granular. The first toe is clearly differentiated.  Digital discs are expanded as with other dendrobatids, with finger discs being at least twice the width of the finger base (Schulte 1986). Coloration is quite variable depending on the population, as this species mimics both color and pattern of several other sympatric (co-occurring) species of poison frogs (Symula et al. 2001).   
 
Ranitomeya imitator near Tarapoto, Peru, closely resembles the sympatric species Ranitomeya variabilis.  Both species have yellow reticulation over a black background on the head, dorsum, flanks, and forearms, resulting in the appearance of large black patches surrounded by yellow . On the venter and legs, both species have blue-green reticulation over a black background, resulting in the appearance of small black patches surrounded by blue-green.  They can be distinguished by the patterning of the black spot on the nose; in R. imitator this spot is split in half by gold reticulation, whereas it is solid in R. variabilis  (Schulte 1986; Symula et al. 2001).  In addition, differences in calls and in egg coloration distinguish the two species (Symula et al. 2001).  
 
In Huallaga Canyon, Peru, Ranitomeya imitator resembles a sympatric population of Ranitomeya fantastica  
(Symula et al. 2001).  Both species in this area have a black ground coloration with yellow stripes, several of which are transverse, running across the body from side to side and extending down the arms and legs and across the midsection  
(as seen in the photos in Symula et al. 2001). However, R. imitator is smaller and has different ventral coloration and pattern, as well as a different call (Schulte 1986). 
 
Near Yurimaguas, Ranitomeya imitator mimics Ranitomeya ventrimaculata  
(Symula et al. 2001).  These frogs share the coloration pattern of thin longitudinal yellow stripes on a black background, over the head, dorsum, and flanks, while the legs have blue-green reticulation over a black background, resulting in the appearance of small black patches surrounded by blue-green color  
(as seen in the photos in Symula et al. 2001).  Here again Ranitomeya imitator appears to be distinguishable by having a black spot on the tip of the snout bisected by a gold stripe. Male calls also differ between the two species (Symula et al. 2001).
","
These frogs can be found on the eastern foothills of the Andes, from 250 to 1000 m in elevation, in Departamentos San Martin and HuÃ¡nuco, Peru (Schulte 1986; Caldwell and Summers 2003).  They inhabit montane wet forest  (Caldwell and Summers 2003; Schulte 1986), and primary lowland tropical moist forest (Icochea et al. 2004) and are usually closely associated with certain secondary forest plant species (Schulte 1986).
","
 Despite the close resemblance of R. imitator to other sympatrically occurring frog species, the call is quite different, and this facilitated the recognition that this frog represented a new species (Schulte 1986).  The call of R. imitator has been described as piercing, and can be heard at some distance (Schulte 1986).

Like other dendrobatids, R. imitator is diurnal. It is also arboreal and can be found in vegetation between 0.3 and 6 m above the ground, though it is mainly active between 0.5 and 1.5 m (Schulte 1986).  The frog's activity period is bimodal, with a peak early in the morning and again in the afternoon, retreating to the shelter of a plant in between (Schulte 1986). Usually only a single frog occupies a ""retreat"" plant, and this territory will be actively and vocally defended if another male trespasses (Schulte 1986).  In addition to calling, the male will position himself such that his head can be seen from below, over the edge of the leaf, with his pulsing black-flecked yellow throat pouch clearly visible against the green background (Schulte 1986).

Ranitomeya imitator is the only known monogamous amphibian, with monogamy in the wild confirmed by paternity analysis in studies (Brown et al. 2010).  Of twelve pairs assessed, all twelve were socially monogamous (interacted only with each other).  However, one pair of the twelve showed social monogamy but not genetic monogamy, as the male was found to have sired tadpoles with another female.  Mate guarding (of males by females) has been observed for this species in captivity, according to Brown et al. (2010).  Both the male and female care for offspring in R. imitator; biparental care in nutrient-poor nurseries appears to have driven the evolution of monogamy,  as two other dendrobatid species (Dendrobates auratus and Dendrobates leucomelas) that also show mate guarding by females but have uniparental (male) tending of offspring are not genetically monogamous (Brown et al. 2010; see references therein for D. auratus and D. leucomelas).

Reproduction occurs year-round, with a peak during the rainy season (Schulte 1986). Males call to lure females to a breeding site, running ahead of the female with the female following 1-5 cm behind (Schulte 1986).  Eggs are white with clear jelly and laid in dark hiding places in phytotelmata (small water pools within plants; Schulte 1986).   Biparental care occurs in this species (Brown et al. 2008a; Brown et al. 2008b; Brown et al. 2010).  About 12-14 days post-hatching, tadpoles will be carried singly (or very rarely, in pairs) by the male to a separate brooding site in a different plant (Schulte 1986).  The water bodies in which the tadpoles are deposited are very small, just 24 ml in volume, and are nutrient-poor, such that tadpoles cannot survive without being provisioned by the female parent (Brown et al. 2008a, Brown et al. 2008b; Brown et al. 2010).  The selection of smaller, nutrient-poor water bodies as nurseries has likely driven the need for biparental care and the evolution of monogamy in this species (Brown et al. 2010).  Parental care is given for an extended time, in this case months, as females must provision the tadpoles with trophic (unfertilized) eggs (Brown et al. 2010).  

Froglets reach adult size after about six months (Schulte 1986).  It is estimated that each pair of adult frogs produces at most two to four offspring a year which reach maturity (Schulte 1986).

This species primarily consumes tiny ants and mites (Schulte 1986; Caldwell and Summers 2003).  It is also reported to prey on drosophilid flies, beetle, and springtails 
 (Schulte 1986; Caldwell and Summers 2003).

Like other dendrobatids, R. imitator secretes alkaloids (including a number from the decahydroquinoline class, and possibly from other classes) from cutaneous granular glands in its skin (Spande et al. 1999). Schulte (1986) reports that a strong characteristic smell is emitted from this frog when it is stressed or killed, which he attributes to the skin toxins.
","

","
Ranitomeya imitator is protected under Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).  Appendix II covers species which are not necessarily threatened with extinction but where controlling trade (import/export) helps avoid overcollecting and thus aids the species' survival. This species has been listed under CITES since 1987. As of 2007, a maximum of 500 ""ranched"" frogs (where eggs or tadpoles are taken from the wild and reared in captivity) per year may be exported from Peru.

Its range overlaps with one protected area, the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul in Peru.  As of 2004, it was deemed stable in population.  It is not thought to tolerate habitat modification, and there has been localized habitat loss.  It does have a wide range and when it was last assessed by the IUCN/Global Amphibian Assessment in 2004, there appeared to be large areas of suitable habitat remaining.  Illegal trade in this species has been noted by IUCN (Icochea et al. 2004).  
","
Found in the pet trade due to its vivid coloration.  The trade in this species is restricted (see Trends and Threats section), and illegal collection has been reported to occur by IUCN.
","
This species is unusual in its mimicry of other species.  It mimics not one but three other species of highly toxic poison frogs (Ranitomeya fantastica, Ranitomeya variabilis, and Ranitomeya ventrimaculata).  This represents the only known example of mimetic radiation in amphibians, where different populations within a single species mimic several other species in appearance. In each case, a population of R. imitator is sympatric with a population of one of the other dendrobatid species, and looks virtually identical.  Despite the similar appearances, in each case the two sympatric species can be distinguished by male calls and by egg coloration.  Ranitomeya imitator populations have been confirmed by molecular phylogenetic analysis to be closely related members of a single species (Symula et al. 2001). 
 
Because both species are toxic in each case, and both benefit from the resemblance, this is an example of MÃ¼llerian mimicry.

In 2011, the genus Dendrobates was subdivided into seven genera, including the new genus Ranitomeya by Brown et al (2011).

Signaling between parents and offspring is a topic of interest in animal behavior and evolution, mostly in birds and mammals. A common question is whether offspring begging directed at parents represents an â€œhonest signalâ€ of need (hunger), or a signal of quality (with larger, higher quality offspring able to signal more strongly). Yoshioka, Meeks and Summers (2016) tested this question in Ranitomeya imitator, the Mimic Poison Frog, which shows pair-bonding and biparental care. The male and female cooperate to place tadpoles in tiny pools of water (phytotelmata), and then return to feed the tadpoles infertile eggs as it develops. They showed regulating food levels across development, tadpoles receiving less food increased begging levels significantly over the course of development, relative to tadpoles given more food. An experiment manipulating the amount of begging that tadpoles perform (under identical feeding regimes) revealed costs of begging in terms of developmental rate and growth. An experiment on parental feeding revealed that parents preferentially fed tadpoles not receiving supplemental food, relative to siblings whose diet was supplemented with extra food. They conclude that tadpole begging in this species serves as an honest signal of need (Written by Kyle Summers).â€¨

Monogamy in vertebrate evolution appears multiple times in separate lineages but their underlying genetic underpinnings are only recently explored.  Young et al. (2019) compared differential gene expression between the transcriptomes of monogamous and polygamous species in five sets of species pairs across vertebrates (mice, voles, birds, frogs and fish). The frog pair were poison frogs Ranitomeya imitator (monogamous) and Oophaga pumilio (polygamous). Tests for differential gene expression between each pair revealed that congruent sets of genes (orthologous or genes of the same evolutionary genealogy) showed concordant changes in expression between the monogamous and the polygamous lineages. The directions of changes in expression in these gene sets were also concordant, such that genes which decreased in expression in the monogamous lineage of one taxonomic pair were likely to decrease in expression in the other monogamous lineages as well (for all pairwise comparisons). However, the frog species were unique in that some genes displayed the opposite direction of change in expression relative to other monogamous lineages. The poison frogs are the only lineage here in which male parental care is ancestral so monogamy with biparental care in this lineage evolved from male care (rather than female care, as in the other taxa). Overall, their research yielded a novel set of 24 candidate genes likely to be involved in the evolution of monogamy, many of which are involved in neural development, synaptic activity and cognitive function. The study provides evidence for widely conserved sets of shared genes and molecular genetic pathways contributing to the evolution of monogamous mating systems across vast gulfs of evolutionary time and change in the vertebrate lineage.

Neotropical poison frogs provide iconic examples of conspicuous warning coloration, yet we know very little about the biochemical mechanisms that underlie the production of these astonishing colors. Twomey et al. (2020) use a combination of spectral reflectance, chromatography, electron microscopy measurements, and simulations of coloration to identify key components of color variation in a mimetic radiation of the Peruvian mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator) and related model species. They revealed that the mimic frog has a broader ""palette"" of colors than the models, which accords with their history of evolving to match the color patterns of other species. Surprisingly, however, the major proportion of variation did not appear to be in pigment types. Instead, the key variation occurred in the thickness of guanine platelets in a type of organelle called iridophores. The variation in platelet thickness appears to influence yellows and oranges, contradicting the traditional view that it should affect structural colors like blues and greens and hue (overall spectral reflectance). Their study provides insight into the underlying mechanisms enabling the evolution of both divergence and convergence in aposematic coloration in the Neotropical poison frogs, revealing novel mechanisms that may apply to other taxa as well.

Poison frogs, with bright colors and potent skin toxins, represent iconic examples of aposematism in rainforests throughout South and Central America. These frogs are also known for intensive parental careâ€“ parents carry tadpoles to small pools (phytotelmata) and some species provide trophic eggs as food for their offsprings. Much interest has focused on the question of whether poison frog tadpoles can acquire toxins for protection from predators by consuming eggs from their mothers. Studies have shown two species of Oophaga provide toxins to their tadpoles via obligate trophic egg feeding. In contrast, in Ranitomeya variabilis (and related R. fantastica, R. summersi) do not provide unfertilized eggs to their tadpoles (instead, they subsist on detritus, algae, and insect larvae), although they will sometimes lay fertilized clutches in or above pools that are later cannibalized by tadpoles.  Villanueva et al. (2022) investigate this issue in a third species of Oophaga (O. granulifera) and in Ranitomeya imitator and R. variabilis. They found that while O. granulifera receives toxins in its eggs (like other members of this genus), that was not true for either species of Ranitomeya. They infer the degree to which egg feeding is facultative (high in R. variabilis, low in R. imitator, not facultative in Oophaga) is related to the evolution of toxin transfer via egg feeding. This is only a single comparison between the Oophaga and Ranitomeya lineages, so further studies will be necessary for definitive conclusions, but their study provides a fascinating and promising first pass at this question.

Neotropical poison frogs are known for their intensive parental care. Male or female parents will carry their tadpoles to bromeliads to provide them with small pools of water where they can develop, safe from fishy predators. In these nutrient poor habitats, some species have evolved egg-feeding, where females lay unfertilized eggs for the tadpoles to eat. In the Peruvian mimic poison frog, Ranitomeya imitator, parents form a pair bond and cooperate in the care of their tadpoles. In this system, Weinfurther et al. (2023) provide preliminary evidence of a symbiotic protist in the guts of the tadpole. In comparative experiments, they switched the diets of R. imitator tadpoles (eggs) with the ancestral diet (detritus) consumed by a related species (R. variabilis) without egg-feeding, and did the reverse (with control treatments for both species). Analyses of gut gene expression revealed elevated expression of proteases in the R. imitator field egg-fed treatment. These digestive proteins came from parabasalians, a group of protists known to form symbiotic relationships with hosts that enhance digestion (especially in termites). Genes encoding these digestive proteins are not present in the R. imitator genome, and phylogenetic analyses shows these mRNA sequences were from parabasalian protists. Bar-coding analyses of the tadpole eukaryotic microbiomes further confirmed this discovery. More study is necessary to confirm whether these parabasalians aid R. imitator tadpoles in protein/ lipid digestion in an egg diet. This may have enabled the exploitation of a key ecological niche (very small, nutrient-poor pools), allowing R. imitator to expand into an area with ecologically similar species (e.g., R. variabilis and R. summersi). In turn, this may have enabled a MÃ¼llerian mimetic radiation, one of only a few examples of this phenomenon in vertebrates. (Written by Kyle Summers)

Parental care in frogs provide an excellent opportunity to examine the evolution of complex sociality, specifically whether increased complexity of care is correlated with the evolution of novel or context-dependent signals as frogs have been models for both animal communication and parental care diversification.  Moss, Tumulty, and Fischer (2023) studied the Mimic Poison Frog (Ranitomeya imitator), a remarkable species displaying monogamy, pair bonding, and biparental care of eggs and tadpoles. Specifically, the authors address whether calls elicited in the context of egg feeding â€“ a cooperative parental behavior in which males lead females to tadpole deposition sites and stimulate them to lay trophic eggs â€“ reflect the evolution of novel signal elements. Combining acoustic and video recordings of pairs in the laboratory, they repeatedly sampled calls of the same individuals in three social contexts â€“ advertisement, courtship, and egg feeding â€“ and characterized and compared call types. Consistent with their prediction, egg feeding calls were distinct from either ancestral call type. These calls have lower dominant frequencies and clipped pulse rates. Despite these differences, there was still considerable overlap between call types, both within and between individuals. This overlap suggests that parental care is coordinated through the use of multi-modal (e.g., visual and olfactory, in addition to acoustic) cues. Their study highlights the complexity of anuran communication systems and the need to characterize vocal repertoires across a an array of social contexts. (Written by Jeanette Moss)

Ranitomeya vanzolinii is a small frog with adults measuring from 16.7-19 mm. Males observed in pairs with females had a mean size of 17.0 +/- 0.6 mm, while paired females had a mean size of 18.6 +/- 0.7 mm (Caldwell, 1997).  This species was first described by Myers  
(1982), who noted that R. vanzolinii can be identified by its coloration, which is consistent between localities separated by hundreds of kilometers and 1200 m in elevation. The body has pale yellow rounded to elongated spots on a black background. Limbs show fine blue reticulation over a black background, sometimes extending onto the digits or palms and soles. In most specimens a few pairs of dorsal spots are connected by pale lines, but spotting is the predominant pattern. The head is narrower than the body.  In lateral profile the snout is rounded, obtuse, or sloping; in dorsal profile, the snout is truncate.  Nares are located laterally on the snout, near the tip.  The tympanum is present and either circular or vertically elliptical in shape, but is concealed posterodorsally.  Teeth are lacking.  Adult males have well-developed vocal slits.  Hands are relatively large (75-90% of head width). The first finger is shorter than the second when adpressed.  Fingers (except for the first finger) have considerably expanded discs, with the discs being at least twice the width of the fingers. The tubercles on the hand lack pigment and thus appear prominent.  A large outer metacarpal tubercle is present on the median base of the palm, as well as a smaller inner metacarpal tubercle on the base of the first finger, and one or two subarticular tubercles on each finger. The hindlimbs are moderately long, with the adpressed heel reaching the eye or tympanum  
(Myers, 1982). 
 
Other dendrobatids also have similar reticulation on the limbs and similar hand structure (Adelphobates quinquevittatus, Ranitomeya fantastica, Ranitomeya reticulatus).  However, these three dendrobatid species have different patterning on the dorsum, with lines, reticulation, or uniform coloration being present. 
In contrast, Ranitomeya vanzolinii is the only one with rounded spots on the dorsum and thus can be easily distinguished. 
(Myers, 1982).

","
Spotted Poison Frogs occur in east-central Peru and the adjacent part of Brazil 
 (Myers, 1982).  They are generally found in primary lowland Amazonian rainforest, in the upper drainages of the Ucayali and JuruÃ¯Â¿Â½ rivers  
(Myers, 1982; Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).  However, there is one record of this species from 1300 m elevation at Tsioventeni, between Rio Ucayali and the headwaters of Rio Pachitea  
(Myers, 1982). Adults are found mainly in the lower understory (less than 6 m above the forest floor), while individuals found in leaf litter tend to be juveniles  
(Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999). 
 

","
Ranitomeya vanzolinii is primarily arboreal as an adult, preferring perches mostly up to 2 m high but occasionally as high as 6 m above the forest floor.  Frogs of this species found in the leaf litter are mostly juveniles (Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).   
  
Ranitomeya vanzolinii form pair bonds and exhibit biparental care, in which males and females remain in pairs to care for their young and feed them.  Both pair bonding and biparental care are unusual for anurans. Ranitomeya vanzolinii is the only frog species so far for which pair bonding has been observed in the wild. During the course of a two-month study, pairs generally appeared to be monogamous, with females remaining within the territories of their mates 
 (Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999). However, Caldwell and De Oliveira  
(1999) did observe one male consorting with two females within his territory.  Males vocalize frequently, both in defense of their territory and to communicate with females through both advertisement and courtship calls 
(Caldwell, 1997; Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).   
 
Following courtship and fertilization, a clutch consisting of one to several fertilized eggs is deposited inside a small tree hole containing water, above the cavity's waterline.  The tree holes are quite small, with the average size being 3.0 x 1.7 cm and 17.9 cm deep.  Primarily holes in saplings and woody vines are used, with preferred cavities located about 1.2 m above the forest floor.  The cavities contain very little water, less than 18 ml on average.  No sunlight enters the tiny openings, precluding algal growth in the water of the treehole.  The diminutive size of the openings also means detritus and macroinvertebrates such as mosquitoes are not found in the water.  Hence there is no source of food for tadpoles in the treeholes  
(Caldwell, 1997; Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).    
 
Tadpoles are reared singly. If the parents deposit more than one fertilized egg in the treehole, the additional tadpoles are not allowed to fall in the water, where they might be consumed by a sibling.  Instead, on hatching, a tadpole crawls onto the male's back and is transported individually by the male parent to another treehole containing water.  A few days later the male guides the female to the new treehole containing their tadpole, using vocalizations (Caldwell, 1997).   
 
When the pair enters the cavity, the frogs court, with the male continuing to call during courtship. Parents remain in the treehole for 2-3 hours.  Periodically during this time the female submerges her posterior half into the  water, with the male calling more softly and sometimes also entering the water alongside her.  When the female is in the water, the tadpole apparently communicates with her by approaching her vent and making rapid swimming movements.  Presumably this signals the female to deposit an unfertilized egg for the tadpole to consume  
(Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).  The majority of eggs deposited for larval consumption are unfertilized  
(Caldwell, 1997).  Tadpoles are not fed every day.  The parents return at approximately five-day intervals (with a range of 1.73-8.5 days) to court each other and feed the offspring  
(Caldwell, 1997).  Females deposit 1-2 eggs at each feeding  
(Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999). 
 
Tadpoles have serrated jaw sheaths, facilitating tearing of the outer egg envelope.  The yolk of the unfertilized egg is consumed by the tadpole but the outer egg jelly capsule is not.  
(Caldwell, 1997; Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).   
 
 Adults hunt during the day and their diet consists mainly of tiny ants and mites.   
(Caldwell and Summers, 2003). 
 
This species appears to be present at high density in the region where it is found, with male territories often adjacent to one another  
(Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).

This species is not threatened. It is abundant in the region where it is found (Caldwell and De Oliveira, 1999).

Ranitomeya variabilis is a small frog; it has a mean snout-vent length of 17.4 mm in adult males and 18.0 mm in females (Brown et al. 2008).

Diagnosis: R. imitator is a MÃ¼llerian mimic of R. variabilis. R. variabilis can be differentiated from R. imitator by egg coloration, vocalization, and subtle coloration differences (Schulte et al. 2001; Schulte et al. 2003). Additionally, R. variabilis is a color and pattern variant of R. ventrimaculata (Schulte et al. 2002).

Coloration: Coloration changes on a gradient from the anterior to posterior, going from a yellow-green to a blue-green. This species has a single nose spot with large, ovid dorsal spotting. Limbs are less than half black with small, even spots (Brown et al. 2008).

","
This species is known only from one habitat in central Peru, along the eastern slope of the Andes in the upper Rio Huallaga drainage, in San Martin Province (Masche et al. 2010).

R. variabilis is semi-arboreal  and lives in secondary to old growth forests and is restricted to the summits of mid-level mountains roughly 900-1200 m above sea level (Brown et al. 2008; Schulte et al. 2002; Icochea 2004). Frogs are found in the understory, canopy, usually above ground on vertical objects, and sometimes in leaf litter (Brown et al. 2008) Despite the frogsâ€™ utilization of pools, R. variabilis is not restricted to areas with certain vegetation or the presence of phytotelmata. (Brown et al. 2009a).

","
R. variabilis is a diurnal species. It has potent alkaloid toxins, as indicated by its aposematic coloration (Brown et al. 2008b; Schulte et al. 2002). 
Males have short buzz-like calls that are relatively low. When a female is present, a male will call from an elevated perch and increase his call rate as she approaches; he then leads her to the breeding site. The call is repeated when a suitable breeding site is reached. Males only called during courtship. (Brown et al. 2008).  
The female lays 2-6 eggs under the surface of the water, in pools that collect in the axils of plants. The male fertilizes them by placing his vent against that of the female (facing opposite directions) while she is laying the eggs, or simply by walking over the already laid eggs. This ritual is performed in pairs or sometimes groups where aggressive male competition has been observed  (Brown et al. 2008).     
Reproduction occurs during the day and has been seen to peak after rain (Brown et al. 2008).  The pools chosen for oviposition, are small to medium sized compared to medium sized pools chosen for tadpole deposition (Brown et al. 2009a).  
Average clutch size is 4 to 5 eggs, which hatch into free-living, lentic larvae; the development period lasts 12 to 14 days depending on the temperature (Masche et al. 2010).
Parental care in R. variabilis is restricted to males only and since males cannot provide the tadpoles with trophic eggs, one of the biggest constraints on the tadpoles is food availability. Males return to the pool to transport tadpoles to reduce predation, and competition. The male tears open the embryo sac, using his rear legs. The tadpoles then either wriggle onto his back or are pushed on by the maleâ€™s rear legs. Males will carry 1 to 6 tadpoles at a time and place them either in their own individual pool or communally in one pool. However, not all males provide parental care (Brown et al. 2009b).
There are costs associated with tadpole distribution. Small pool size may cause an increase in intraspecific and interspecific competition for food. This poses a tradeoff between safety from predators and nutrient availability, as tadpoles in small pools are more susceptible to starvation (Brown et al. 2009a).
Males may selectively deposit their tadpoles into pools already occupied by unrelated individuals, exhibiting tactical reproductive parasitism (Brown et al. 2009b).  Multiple depositions into the same pool will select for tadpoles that compete vigorously and resist cannibalism from conspecifics (Brown et al. 2009a).

","
Tadpole/Larval Morphology: The body is depressed. There is a sinistral spiracle on the lower left side of the body and a short medial vent tube on the ventral fin (Masche et al. 2010). It has dorsal, circular nostrils; dorsal eyes that are directed dorsolaterally (Masche et al. 2010). The number of marginal papillae, the presence of jaw sheath serrations, jaw sheath keratinization, and tail color change over the developmental stages (Schulte et al. 2003). 

The caudal musculature of the tadpoles is narrow near the posterior tail tip and becomes moderately robust near the anterior.  Fins do not extend onto the body of the tadpole and are subequal in height. The caudal fin tip is rounded and there is an anteroventrally directed mouth with an emarginated oral disc. There is a single row of 32 marginal papillae surrounding the oral disk and there are no submarginal papillae. On the marginal papillae of the lips there are two gaps: a small medial gap on the posterior lip and a large medial gap on the anterior lip. Two anterior rows of teeth are not completely keratinized and are equal in length. The upper jaw sheath has slender lateral processes but, like the V-shaped lower jaw sheath, it is moderately robust with serrated edges over its entire length (Masche et al. 2010).  

Tadpole Coloration: The tadpoles have grey to dark black-brownish pigmentation (Brown et al. 2008b ; Masche et al. 2010). A single nose spot is present, differentiating the species from R. imitator which has a paired nose spot.  In both dorsal and lateral profiles, the snout is rounded (Brown et al. 2008). 
","
â€¨R. variabilis is threatened by agricultural development, the pet trade to some degree, and habitat fragmenation from the harvesting of wood. The species has not been found in or moved into any protected areas (Icochea 2004).

Poison frogs, with bright colors and potent skin toxins, represent iconic examples of aposematism in rainforests throughout South and Central America. These frogs are also known for intensive parental careâ€“ parents carry tadpoles to small pools (phytotelmata) and some species provide trophic eggs as food for their offsprings. Much interest has focused on the question of whether poison frog tadpoles can acquire toxins for protection from predators by consuming eggs from their mothers. Studies have shown two species of Oophaga provide toxins to their tadpoles via obligate trophic egg feeding. In contrast, in Ranitomeya variabilis (and related R. fantastica, R. summersi) do not provide unfertilized eggs to their tadpoles (instead, they subsist on detritus, algae, and insect larvae), although they will sometimes lay fertilized clutches in or above pools that are later cannibalized by tadpoles.  Villanueva et al. (2022) investigate this issue in a third species of Oophaga (O. granulifera) and in Ranitomeya imitator and R. variabilis. They found that while O. granulifera receives toxins in its eggs (like other members of this genus), that was not true for either species of Ranitomeya. They infer the degree to which egg feeding is facultative (high in R. variabilis, low in R. imitator, not facultative in Oophaga) is related to the evolution of toxin transfer via egg feeding. This is only a single comparison between the Oophaga and Ranitomeya lineages, so further studies will be necessary for definitive conclusions, but their study provides a fascinating and promising first pass at this question.

The Skittering frog is one of the most widely distributed frogs. It extends from Thailand to Nepal, throughout India, almost throughout Pakistan below 1800 m (Khan 1997c). It extends westward to Iran and Afghanistan. Its several races have been described from Pakistan. Its Saudi Arabian population was described as a distinct species, Euphlyctis ehrenbergii Peter (Balletto et al. 1985).






","
Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis is a highly aquatic and littoral frog. It remains permanently resident in different types of habitats with pooled water, in the plains and submountainous parts of Pakistan. The frog is remarkably capable of adjusting itself to the uncertain aquatic conditions in  temperate arid parts of Pakistan. 

 Its peculiar unique habit of skittering over the water surface, is reported by the Mogul Emperor Babar in his autobiography (Beveridge 1979; Khan and Tasnim, 1989).   
          
 The frog either floats or remains squatting in the vegetation along marginal water. An intruder initiates the frogâ€™s skipping behavior during which the flattened and inflated ventral surface of the body rests on the water surface while the push comes from the completely distended webbed feet which steer the body forward so that the frog is speedily carried to the  center of the pond. When further provoked, it plunges into the depths. 
 The frog can tolerate a wide range of pH variations, from fresh water to considerably  brackish and  polluted refuse water; it thrives equally well in sewer systems of towns and cities. 
 Individual frogs call from permanent water bodies almost throughout the year. However, active breeding activity is initiated as early summer water temperature rises to 10-12oC (Khan and Malik 1987b). The calling males usually gather  in a corner of a pond with some marginal vegetation.  Some sit on the moist margin others float. The tone of call is very variable, depending on water and atmospheric temperatures, and the age and breeding state of the frogs. It is just ""chuutt, chuutt, chuutt"" repeated several times. Calling males are very active, calling and squeaking and continuously jumping over each other, causing commotion in the pond water. They actively  assault each other in reproductive frenzy. When a pair is formed it does not leave the site. A female may pair with several males, laying  eggs with each. 
 In Balochistan Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis breeds sympatrically with Paa sternosignata, and in northern hilly tracts with   Tomopterna breviceps. Often its relatively active males pair with relatively docile frogs of these species. No eggs are known to result from such pairings (Khan 1987; Khan and Ahmed 1987). 
Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis is a voracious feeder, feeding mostly on aquatic insects, beetles, tadpoles, dragonflies, grasshoppers, fry, etc. It is known to come out of the water during the night and go foraging in the surrounding grass, returning to the pond at dawn. 

This tadpole remains solitary, stays most of the time at the bottom, feeds mostly on debris, almost clogging its digestive tract. Usually no fresh vegetation is detected in its digestive tract. It also feeds on dead tadpoles, drowned animals like earthworms, etc. It attacks sympatric tadpoles and feeds on them (Khan and Mufti 1995).

Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis tadpoles are most common in water bodies throughout the plains of Punjab and Sindh, from late February to mid-September. 
 






","

","
Although the frog is very common in every type of small or large water bodies, the pollutants in water do affect the frog. Either adults are killed or migrate to new ponds. However, tadpoles and eggs perish.

The frog and its tadpoles are common in the diet of herons and other water visiting  birds. It is included in the dietary of several common snakes, varanids and crocodiles.

Drainage of wetlands are direct threats to this species.


","
It is pest exterminator, feeds voraciously on different insects and their larvae.

Description: Fejervarya cancrivora has a SVL of 68.2 mm.  The sides of the head have small glandular warts. Parts of the flanks have glandular folds and the lower part has glandular warts. The back has interrupted dorsolateral folds. The dorsal sides of the limbs have warts and folds, while the ventral surfaces are smooth. It has a medium sized, narrow head. The snout is oval. F. cancrivora has a rounded canthus rostralis, a concave loreal region, and a flat interorbital space. The nostrils, which are closer to the tip of the snout than the eye, are oval and have a small flap. The tympanum is distinct. The pupil is rounded. It has a few teeth between the choanae on the vomerine ridge. The tongue is large. It has a supratympanic fold. No parotoid glands are present. The fingers are long and the finger tips are pointed. Some of the fingers have dermal fringes, but have no webbing. Subarticular tubercles are present and are rounded. Toes are long and have webbing and dermal fringes (Dubois and Ohler 2000). 
Diagnosis: F. cancrivora can be distinguished from F. limnocharis by having a deeper head and a more pointed beak-like snout (McKay 2006).
Coloration: Color varies from brown, or greenish-brown, to gray, with irregular darker bars scattered on the lips and hindlimbs. The venter is whitish, sometimes with scattered darker markings (McKay 2006).

Coloration in Preservation: The dorsum and flanks are brown with indistinct brown spots. A wide, light brown mid-dorsal band runs from the tip of the snout to the vent. Vocal sacs are dark brown. The belly and undersides are white with light brown spots (Dubois and Ohler 2000).

Variation: Males have nuptial spines on the nuptial pads and vocal sacs are present (Dubois and Ohler 2000). Mature males may or may not have dark throats and thumbs, and sometimes lack slits opening to the vocal sac (McKay 2006).

Tadpole Morphology: Tadpoles have a maximum total length of 40 mm. The body is oval-shaped and dark-colored with dark spots. The tail is less than twice the body length. The spiracle is centered on one side of the body. The mouth is situated under the snout. The upper lip has a single row of papillae and the lower lip has two rows. (McKay 2006).

","
F. cancrivora is widely distributed in southeastern Asia, including Brunei Darussalam, India (Great Nicobar Island), Indochina (Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Thailand, Viet Nam), coastal southern China (Hainan and Guangxi provinces), the Philippines, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Irian Jaya (Ren et al. 2009; Zhigang et al. 2009), as well as in Bali (McKay 2006). It has been introduced to Guam (Christy et al. 2007) and to Papua New Guinea (Zhigang et al. 2009). Along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand and in Singapore, F. cancrivora is usually found in mangrove swamps (Dicker and Elliott 1970). It is also common on the banks of brackish meanders, at the edges of tidal prawn ponds, and in fresh water areas (Elliott and Karunakaran 1974; Ren et al. 2009). In Bali, F. cancrivora is found in lowland rainforests, lower montane forests, monsoon forests, forest edges, mangroves, other brackish waterways, and agricultural areas up to 1300 m asl (McKay 2006).
","
Although it is not the only amphibian that can withstand salinity (Xenopus laevis and Bufo viridis can tolerate 20 and 26 ppt of salinity, respectively), F. cancrivora is the only living amphibian species that can inhabit saline waters constantly (Ren et al. 2009). This species can adapt to environments of widely different salinity. It can adapt from freshwater pools to full-strength sea water, in only a few hours. The rate of water movement through its skin is the same at any osmolarity, whether the external medium consists of NaCl, sucrose, or urea. F. cancrivora accomplishes this by raising the osmolar concentration of its plasma greater than that of the external fluids (Dicker and Elliott 1970); it rapidly accumulates urea through inducing a key enzyme in urea synthesis (Ren et al. 2009). The animal's skin glands may also contribute to its salinity tolerance. Unlike other species, F. cancrivora has three types of skin glands: mucous glands, mixed glands, and vacuolated glands, in respective order of abundance (Seki et al. 1995). F. cancrivora has been reported to tolerate external salinities from 650 to 950 mOsm/L for several months (Dicker and Elliott 1970).
F. cancrivora forages in sea water of about 1000-1100 mOsm/L (Dicker and Elliott 1970). The diet of frogs near brackish water is predominantly crustacean, including crabs. On the other hand, the diet of frogs near fresh water is comprised mainly of insects and some small vertebrates frogs. The choice-limiting factor appears to be prey size only (Elliott and Karunakaran 1974).

F. cancrivora breeds year-round, but is most active at the beginning of the wet season. The call sounds like a fast throat gargle (McKay 2006). 

","

","
Although the species is abundant, over-harvesting, habitat destruction, wood harvest from mangrove forests, human settlement expansion and road construction may threaten populations (Zhigang et al. 2009).
","
As much as 75% of Indonesia's exported frog legs for food consumption consists of F. cancrivora. Frogs are captured mostly in Java and are generally large and sexually mature (Kusrini and Alford 2006).
","
F. limnocharis is the most closely related to  F. cancrivora (Ren et al. 2009).

This Species was featured in News of the Week 18 July 2022: 
Amphibians are generally considered saltwater intolerant, although many amphibian species are found in coastal areas. How will climate changes such as increasing temperature, sea levels, and storm surge events impact amphibian survival? Using three coastal frog species (Duttaphrynus melanostictus, Fejervarya limnocharis and Microhyla fissipes), Chuang et al. (2022) tested the effects of salinity on both tadpole survival and the ability to withstand high temperatures (critical thermal maxima or CTmax). They found in all species exposure to high salinity treatments lowered survival, the maximum temperature that tadpoles could withstand, and development rate. Their study shows that rising temperatures and increased salinity exposure might be a double whammy for tadpoles. This study highlights the importance of including and measuring multiple stressors in climate changes studies because environments are predicted to change in multiple ways that can have compounding effects on organisms.

Nanorana parkeri is a small frog that lives in the Tibet plateau southwest of China. Males of  have a snout-vent length ranging from 40 â€“ 51 mm. Females have a snout-vent length ranging from 39 â€“ 58 mm. The snout is blunt and protrudes out slightly. The head width is longer than the head length. The nostrils are close to the eyes and the distance between the nostrils is larger than the eye diameter. Nanorana parkeri does not have tympanums or tympanic rings (Fei et al. 2009).

The limbs are relatively short compared to the body size. The forearms are shorter than half of the body length. The fingers are slender and round and the tips are also round. The relative finger lengths are III = I > II > IV. The subarticular tubercles are small and clear, and more obvious under the third finger than all other fingers. The inner palmer tubercle is very obvious whereas the outer palmer tubercle is much smaller and less obvious. The hind-limbs barely reach the front of the shoulder when appressed to the body. The heels meet or overlap slightly with each other when pressed to the body at right angles. The feet are longer than the shins. The toes are slender with slightly swollen tips. The relative toe lengths are IV > III = V > II >I. There is well developed webbing between the toes and small, indistinct subarticular on the toes (Fei et al. 2009).

The skin is rough, with an exception of the head. There is no dorsal lateral fold but there are 5 - 10 rows of regularly shaped tubercles with fine spines scattered in-between the tubercles (Fei et al. 2009).

Nanorana parkeri is the most similar to the two other species of the same genus: N. pleskei and N. ventripunctata. Nanorana pleskei is slightly smaller. Males of N. pleskei are around 32 mm long and females are around 36 mm long. Nanorana pleskei has a small tympanum and clear tympanic ring. The subarticular tubercles are indistinct under both the toes and fingers of N. pleskei. Nanorana parkeri has dark stripes on the dorsal surface while N. pleskei has oval-shaped markings with clearly defined edges. Nanorana parkeri also has grayish brown speckling on the belly that N. pleskei does not possess.

Nanorana ventripunctata is about the same size as N. parkeri. However, the subarticular tubercles are apparent and distinct under all fingers and toes of N. ventripunctata. Speckling on the belly of N. ventripunctata is darker than speckling on the belly of N. parkeri. Nanorana ventripunctata also has irregularly shaped and arranged marks on the dorsal surface that differ from the dark-colored stripes on the dorsal surface of N. parkeri (Fei et al. 2009).

In life, the dorsal surface of N. parkeri is olive green with dark brown or black stripes. There is a dark brown stripe starting from the tip of the snout to the end of the temporal fold.  The belly is brownish yellow or grayish white, with scattered gray and brown speckling. The iris is bicolored, brownish green on the top half and tea-leaf brown on the lower half. In preservative, the dorsal surface is grayish brown or dark brown, clear dark-colored stripes. The belly is grayish white or yellowish white (Fei et al. 2000, Fei et al. 2009).

Sexual dimorphism is present in Nanorana parkeri. Males have stronger forelimbs with dark brown nuptial spines on the first and second fingers. Nuptial pads are present on the base of the first finger, and some males have it on the third fingers. Males also have fine brown spine clusters on the chest, showing an upside-down â€œVâ€ pattern. Some males have spines on the inside of the upper arm. Vocal sacs are absent males (Fei et al. 2009).

","
Nanorana parkeri is only found in the Tibet Plateau (specific to Lhasa, Dangxiong, Nagqu, Nimu, Namulin, Langkazi, Jiangyan, Shigastse, Angren, Zhongba, Nie Lamu, Dingri, Dingjie, Gamba, Kangma, Ya Dong, Wanna, Longzi, Naidong, Qusong, Langxian, Milin, Gongbu Jiangda, Linzhi, Bomi, Baju, Wuqiqi), Pakistan, and Nepal. Nanorana parkeri inhabits lakes, ponds, marshlands, nearby streams and rivers at altitudes between 2850 â€“ 4700 m (Fei et al. 2009).
","
On sunny days, N. parkeri is found hiding in the grass, muddy caves, and under the rocks close to a water source. Only a few individuals are active during the day. Most individuals are active only after sunset. Nanorana parkeri are more active on rainy or cloudy days and can be found on the ground or the surface of rocks. When disturbed, N. parkerijump directly into the water. In general, adults of N. parkeri are inactive (Fei et al. 2009).

Nanorana parkeri has a relatively long breeding season, starting at the beginning of May and lasting until the end of August. The peak breeding time is May and June. During the breeding season, N. parkeri is found in pairs of males and females. During non-breeding seasons, N. parkeri is found in separate groups of males and females (Fei et al. 2009).

Tadpoles are active during the day and more active at night. Tadpoles are often found swimming in-between water weeds at the depth between 3 â€“ 10cm. Fewer tadpoles are found in deeper water (Fei et al. 2009).

The species authority is: Stejneger, L. (1927). â€œA new genus and species of frog from Tibet.â€ Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences  17: 317-319.

According to analysis based on ancestral traits, the most closely related sister species of Nanorana parkeri are N. pleiski and N. ventripunctata (Che et al. 2010).

Geographic genetic structure is present within Nanorana parkeri with western and eastern population being highly differentiated according to the results based on pairwise mean relative divergence and absolute sequence divergence analysis of the whole genome of 63 individuals (Wang et al. 2018).

In 2015, the whole genome of N. parkeri was sequenced. Maximum likelihood analysis suggests that N. parkeri and Xenopus tropicalis diverged approximately 266 Ma (Sun et al. 2015). 

Nanorana parkeri was named by Stejneger after Dr. H. W. Parker, in recognition of his help in clearing up important points connected with the investigation (Stejneger 1927). In Chinese, this is commonly referred as â€œGao Shan Wo Waâ€ (Xizang Plateau Frog) (Fei et al. 2000).

This species was featured as News of the week on 21 May 2018: 
One of the first frogs to have its whole genome sequenced is Nanorana parkeri, a Tibetan frog that breeds at elevations from 2,800 m to almost 5,000 m, making it perhaps the highest elevation frog. A research team has used availability of its genome to study variation along geographic and elevational gradients (Wang et al. 2018). Genomes were obtained from 63 individuals and used to study adaptation and species formation. Selection was detected in 579 highly divergent genomic regions, involving 365 genes in 51 functional classes. High altitude adaptation was evidenced in genes associated with blood circulation, response to hypoxia and UV radiation. Such adaptation plays a significant role in maintaining and driving continued divergence, even leading to reproductive isolation. The paper opens a new era in the study of genomics of natural populations of amphibians (Written by David B. Wake).

Males are about 98mm long; females are about 99mm.  The head is slightly flat and wide, with round snout, diamond shaped pupils, horizontal grooves behind the eyes, and hardly visible eardrums.  The interorbital space is about the same as the width of its eyelid.  The body is sturdy. The dorsal surface is grayish or yellowish palm-brown, with ovary shaped tubercles that are aligned from head to end, round granules among tubercles, and small black protrusions on the granules. The ventral surface is grayish white or yellow, with scattered gray marks. The forelimbs are strong with hardly visible strips; hind legs are short, but the heels of hind legs can meet or overlap.  Feet fully webbed, with round toe tips. The fringe outside of the fifth toe only connects to the bottom of the toe.  Tarsal fold presents. 
 
The ventral surface of the female is smooth. Males have nuptial pads on the inner four toes, a pair of large nuptial pads on the chest, an inner vocal sack beneath the throat, but no male glands.  
 
Eggs are about 4mm in diameter, gray or black in color.  The tadpoles are about 52mm in length, with head-body lengthabout 20mm.  The dorsal is palm-brown in color, with scattered dark marks.  The tale is light-palm color, with a dull tip.  The labial tooth row is often I:4-4 / II:1-1.  One row of lower labial papillae located in the middle, and two rows on the sides.

The Yunnan Spiny Frog resides in rocky streams among mountain forests.  The species is found in Southern China provinces: Sichuan (Southeast side: Zhaojue, Yayuan, Muli, Dechang, Huili, Huidong, Pazhihua, Laibo, Mianning, Jiulong), Yunan, Guizhou (Weiting, Suiyang, Songtao, Wangmo, Libo, Xingyi), Hunan (Suining), Hubei (Tongshan?)  The elevation ranges from 1330 to 2400m asl in China, and from 800 to 1,000m asl at Sa Pa, Vietnam.
","
The Yunnan Spiny Frog often squat on moss-covered rocks near  creeks. The breeding season is long.  Patches of eggs or embryos can be found between April and June. Eggs are often in string shape, half-floating in the stream, while attached to the parts of rocks that are merged in water.  The tadpoles live in ponds,  and often hide beneath rocks or in fallen leaves. 
","

","
One main issue is over collection for human consumption. The species is also affected by habitat destruction, agricultural expansion, deforestation, water pollution, and infrastructure development due to human settlement. 
","
Collected for human consumption, the number of wild harvest out of total population has decreased over the past five years.

Quasipaa exilispinosa is a medium to large-sized frog, slightly toad-like in appearance, with a snout-vent length up to 10 cm, but males usually average 7 â€“ 8 cm and females average 5.7 cm (Chan et al. 2005). It has a depressed body (Karsen et al. 1998, Liu and Hu 1975); numerous wrinkles and a distinct supratympanic fold extending from behind the eyes to the shoulder, concealing part of the tympanum (Karsen et al. 1998). Males have spines on the chest and fingers during the breeding season. Its toes are partially webbed while the fingers are not webbed (Chan et al. 2005).

Tadpoles are about 40 mm in length. Young froglets are fairly large and globular, about 20 mm in snout-vent length (Liu and Hu 1975, Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005).

DIAGNOSIS: 
As of 2021, the genus Quasipaa contains 12 species. Two species are found in Vietnam: Q. acanthophora (Dubois and Ohler 2009) from Lang Son, Bac Giang, and Quang Ninh Provinces; and Q. delacouri (Angel 1928) also from Lang Son and Bac Giang Provinces. One species, Q. fasciculispina (Inger 1970), is found in southeastern Thailand and southwestern Cambodia. The remaining nine species are distributed in, but not all restricted to, China: Q. boulengeri (Gunther 1889) from the China-Vietnam border area northward to southern Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces, and east to western Jiangxi and southern Hunan Provinces; Q. courtoisi (Angel 1922) from Che-Ki, Anhui Province; Q. exilispinosa (Liu and Hu 1998) found in Fujian, western and northern Guangxi, southern Hunan, and Guangdong Provinces (including Hong Kong); Q. spinosa (David 1875) from eastern Guizhou, Yunnan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong Provinces (including Hong Kong), to northern and central Vietnam; Q. jiulongensis (Huang and Liu 1985) from southwestern Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces; Q. robertingeri (Wu and Zhao 1995) from southeastern Sichuan Province; Q. shini (Ahl 1930) from Guangxi, Guangzhou, Hunan, and Guizhou Provinces; Q. verrucospinosa (Bourret 1937) from southern Yunnan Province, China to Vietnam and Laos; Q. yei (Chen, Qu, and Jiang 2002) from Anhui, Hubei, and Henan Provinces.

Quasipaa exilispinosa can be distinguished from congeners by a number of morphological traits. Firstly, Q. exilispinosa (male snout-vent length: 7 â€“ 8 cm, female snout-vent length: average 5.7 cm) is about half the size of its closest relative, Q. spinosa (snout-vent length of 10 â€“ 14 cm) (Fei 1999). Unlike other members of the Quasipaa genus that have fully webbed hind digits, Q. exilispinosa the fourth digits the feet are only partially webbed (Fei 1999, Fei 2012). Quasipaa exilispinosa has a partially concealed eardrum while other species, such as Q. spinosa, have fully concealed eardrums (Chan et al. 2005).

COLORATION: 

The color of a live specimenâ€™s dorsal surface can range from light to dark brown, with visible yellow buff mottling scattered throughout. The lips are barred with dark brown bands. Dark brown horizontal banding can also be found between the eyes. Distinct horizontal dark brown bars are found on the dorsal surface of both front and hind limbs, digits, thighs, and tibia. Similar, but less apparent, horizontal bars can also be found on the tarsus and lips. Digit tips range from bright yellow to transparent white. The ventral surface is an ashy yellow that diffuses into light brown along the ventrolateral glands. Males, during breeding seasons, will further develop dark spines on the chest and fingers. The ventral surfaces of the thighs are transparent pink while the underside of its crus is yellow with brown dusting. The upper chest is light pink, which becomes darkish brown with scattered light-yellow flecks similar to that of the dorsal surface. Its iris is uniformly copper red with fine black reticulations throughout, and a distinct dark cross-shaped marking with a black pupil at its center (Liu and Hu 1975, Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005, Fei 2009 and 2012).

A preserved specimen has a greyish-brown dorsal surface and creamy-white chest and belly. Greyish bands are still distinguishable on the limbs. The underside of all limbs is pale grey.

Tadpoles are brownish yellow in color with black bands on the tail and black spots at the base of the tail; there is no apparent ventral coloration (Liu and Hu 1975, Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005).

","
Quasipaa exilispinosa are mostly found along the southern and southeastern coasts of China. They have been recorded from southern counties of Hunan Province (Mangshan Mountain in Yizhang and Guidong Counties), eastern and northern Jiangxi Province (Guixi, Xunwu, and Pingbian Counties), Fujian Province (Mount Wuyi in Jianyang, Nanjing, Dehua and Zhao'an Counties), northern and western Guangxi Province (Longsheng County and Cenwanglao Mountain), northeastern to central Guangdong Province (Ruyuan and  Longmen County, Nanling Mountain in Dading County), western to central Zhejiang (Longwang Mountain, Jiulong Mountain and Tonglu, Quzhou and Jingning Counties); northern Anhui Province (Xiuning County). The species is widely distributed in Hong Kong, being one of the most common hill stream frogs. They occur at all altitudes, in and near hill streams, though they occur most frequently at 500 â€“ 1400 m elevation (Fei 2012). 
","
This species is nocturnal and is often seen perched on rocks, in crevices, beside swift-flowing waters or ledges, beneath small waterfalls and quiet pools. During the day, they hide under rocks and leaf litter (Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005).

Quasipaa exilispinosa feeds on small frogs and arthropods, such as insects and freshwater crabs (Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005, Fei 2012).

It breeds in the wet season (May to September in Hong Kong). During this period, males become territorial (Programmes n.d.), develop black spines on their chest and fingers, and make loud and continuous mating calls at night that sound like â€œduk...duk...dukâ€¦â€ (To hear the call, click the call link above by Ho Yuen Yeung) (Liu and Hu 1975, Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005).

Females lay 54 â€“ 107 eggs (Fei 2012). The eggs are large (~3 mm in diameter), creamy white and grey, and are laid singly (i.e., not in strands). The eggs can be seen lying at the bottom of shallow pools, attached to rocks. Groups of 5 â€“ 10 eggs are wrapped in transparent capsules, 10 mm in diameter (Liu and Hu 1975, Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005). 

This species has an extended larval phase and tadpoles may overwinter (Liu and Hu 1975, Karsen et al. 1998, Chan et al. 2005).

Predators include snakes, turtles, and bigger frogs that inhabit similar habitats and are widely distributed within the region, such as the diamondback water snake (Trimerodytes aequifasciata), mountain water snake (Trimerodytes percarinatus percarinatus) and possibly the introduced red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) (Karsen et al. 1998).

","

","
Quasipaa exilispinosa is susceptible to habitat loss and destruction, and water pollution.
","
Some species within the Quasipaa genus are known to be consumed as food or harvested for medicinal properties, but specific information for Q. exilispinosa is unclear (Chan et al. 2013).
","
PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS:
A complete mitochondrial genome analysis conducted by Wu et al. (2020) using Bayesian phylogenetic inference. The study supported Q. exilispinosaâ€™s inclusion within the genus Quasipaa, as well as a close relationship with a morphologically similar relative Q. spinosa.

Phylogenetic analysis with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA revealed two subclades within the Quasipaa genus, the first clade, which Q. exilispinosa is a member of, contains species that occur at low elevations, throughout China southward from Sichuan Province in the west to Henan Province in the east, extending into south-central Vietnam and southern Laos (Jing et al. 2009). The second clade includes species with distributions ranging from southern Yunnan Province southward into northern Laos and northern Vietnam. In accordance with the phylogenetic study of Wu et al. (2020), Q. exilispinosa and Q. spinosa are sister species, and this clade is the sister group of Q. jiulongensis.

Quasipaa was first proposed as a subgenus of Paa, which is now considered to belong to the dicroglossid genus Nanorana. Quasipaa was subsequently raised to the level of genus, and molecular phylogenetic analyses have corroborated its monophyly (Dubois 1992). Many individual species of Quasipaa were originally described in the genus Rana. Even after splitting the genus Rana into smaller genera, frogs in Quasipaa were previously classified as members of the true frog family Ranidae, and within the subfamily Dicroglossinae, that is until Dicroglossinae was raised to the family level, (Dicroglossidae), where they remain (Frost 2013).

Known as the Puerto Rican coqui, this is a small frog, 34 mm SVL in males and to 41 mm SVL in females.  The dorsal colors vary from brown to grayish-brown with highly variable color patterns. On the dorsal surface it varies from uniform brown to gray and may have a faint ""M"" between its shoulders. It may also  have two broad cream or light colored dorsolateral stripes irregularly bordered with tiny black spots. Some individuals have a broad cream or light colored band across the head between the eyes. The belly is white or yellow, stippled with brown. These frogs have large toe pads with no webbing between the toes. The eye color varies from brown to gold. (Conant and Collins 1991).  
 
 
 

","
This species is native to Puerto Rico (Conant and Collins 1991).  
 
 
 

","
Coqui frogs are forest habitat generalists, however, in their native range in Puerto Rico, Beard, McCullough, and Eschtruth (2003) quantified their microhabitat partitioning by life stages. Adults were found in a large range of heights of vegetation from the ground seeming to prefer heights ca. 1 m above the forest floor. Juveniles were often found in vegetation but preferred vegetation closer to the ground. 

Coqui frogs are nocturnal when males will call exceptionally loudly. Females and juveniles typically forage during their active times. Where present, coqui have some of the highest density of amphibian species (Beard et al 2003).
","
This species of frog is a direct developer. The adults lay eggs on land and they hatch directly into subadult frogs. The free-swimming tadpole stage, common in many frogs, is completely lacking in this species (Conant and Collins 1991).  
","
Direct-developing species like Eleutherodactylus coqui are considerably less likely to be affected by chytridiomycosis than are species with free-living tadpoles, but chytrid infection has been reported in this species from Puerto Rico (Beard and O'Neill 2005).
","
This charismatic and vocal frog has been introduced in several countries and US states, where the high densities and loud calls have socio-economic and ecosystem impacts. See Global Invasive Species Database Species profile.
","
This species was featured as news of the week September 26, 2022: 
The global pet trade and transport networks have accelerated the number of introduced amphibian and reptile species worldwide, some becoming invasive problems and have caused extirpation or declines of native species and disruptions of ecosystems. Furthermore, these invasions impact socio-economies (i.e., monetary and social impacts) and human health (i.e., spread of disease). In a first attempt to quantify the financial costs, Soto et al (2022) analyzed the global economic costs caused by invasive alien herpetofauna using a dataset of 21 herpetofauna species, six amphibian and 15 reptile invasive species. They showed the cost of invasive species generally increased over time but peaked between 2011 and 2015 for amphibians and 2006 to 2010 for reptiles. Invasive herpetofauna cost approximately a total of 17.0 billion US$ between 1986 and 2020 and was predominantly associated with the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), with 6.0 and 10.3 billion US$ in costs, respectively. Geographically, Oceania and Pacific Islands recorded 63% of total costs, followed by Europe (35%) and North America (2%). The sector most affected by amphibians was authorities-stakeholders through post-invasion species management (>â€‰99%), while for reptiles, impacts were reported mostly through damages to mixed sectors (65%). The results from this study might suggest research biases towards well-known taxa; however, it highlights the importance of synthesizing the cost of herpetofauna invasion to provide a better framework for regulatory policies and investment in control or biosecurity measures (e.g., trade of alien pets).

A small, dull-colored frog, adult males are 17-25 mm long and adult females, 17-35 mm.  Brown to gray tan dorsal ground color with usually one or two darker chevrons.  Often a narrow middorsal pinstripe or a broad pair of dorsal stripes.  Marbled, stippled, or blotched on a dark brown to gray tan ground posterior thigh surface and creamy undersurface.  Iris gold above and brownish below (Savage 2002). 
Smooth to slightly tuberculate dorsum; head a little broader than long; snout truncate from above; large eyes with eyelids that have many low, rounded tubercles.  Distinct tympanum; oblique vomerine odontophores.  Distinct, small, rounded  finger and toe disks; lacks digital webbing.  Many small plantar tubercles; elongate inner metatarsal tubercle larger than conical outer metatarsal tubercle; lacks tarsal fold.  Adult males have paired vocal slits and a distensible internal subgular vocal sac strongly granular when uninflated; lacks nuptial thumb pads (Savage 2002).

Diet: Eats mostly ants, but also spiders, leafhoppers, and springtails (Savage 2002). 

Mating Behavior: During wet season, peaks around June to August (Ovaska 1991; Savage 2002).  
Females approach calling males to initiate courtship.  Repeatedly, a male moves away, calling softly, and the female follows until both reach a possible oviposition site.  Other males may follow and compete for the female with calls and, sometimes, physical means.  Female accepts male by backing under him.  Male clasps female in axillary amplexus or perches on her back; less often, a pair uses a reverse hind leg clasp, a position only known  in E. coqui, which has internal fertilization.  Both go through abdominal pulsations and body spasms before the female begins to lay eggs (Bourne 1997).  

Eggs and Froglets: Clutches found throughout the year but most often during the wettest months and contain 10-30 unpigmented eggs covered in a thin layer of viscous mucus.  Newly laid, egg diameters average around 3.0 mm.  Froglets hatch from the eggs by using an egg tooth located on the tip of the snout. They have snout vent lengths of about 4.0 mm.  Their short stumpy tails disappear within a day, and the froglets reach sexual maturity in about one year (Bourne 1997; Savage 2002). 

Call: Two-note whistle that can be repeated at a maximum of 60 times per minute.  First note, frequency about 2 kHz for 70-90 milliseconds.  Longer second note, lasting 180-270 milliseconds, that rises sharply from about 3 to 4 kHz.  Average interval between calls is 1.2 seconds (Savage 2002). 
Oviposition calls are identical to diurnal retreat calls, but are different from lead away calls of initial courtship by duration and frequency (Bourne 1997).

E. johnstonei is often introduced as a stowaway via trade amongst the islands and outcompetes local frog species in tougher environments, therefore increasing its own population distribution.  Intensive monitoring is needed of each island with E. johnstonei and native species to see if the former is responsible for the decline of the latter.  If there is confirmation that E. johnstonei is responsible, suggested methods in controlling population levels are to initiate management programs to educate officials, tighten control over agricultural imports, monitor range at intervals and boundaries by geographic information system, and preserve native habitats (Kaiser 1997).

A plump, almost cylindrical frog with a very pointed snout and short but sturdy limbs. It has short limbs and a large, flanged inner metatarsal tubercle. Males measure 22â€“34 mm (SVL), weighing 1.3 to 5.0 g. Females bearing no eggs weigh 5.8â€“6.3 g, otherwise 7.7â€“12 g (SVL: 37â€“49 mm). A bulging dermal fold separates the neck and the snout regions. Males have a single subgular vocal sacs which are usually covered by a small gular flap. They have small eyes with vertically slit pupils. These frogs have no visible tympanum. Both the hardened snout and the large inner metatarsal tubercles have been transformed into digging tools. The inner metatarsal tubercle reaches 0.9â€“1.9 of the shortest toe length. The thighs reach 0.2â€“0.4, the lower legs 0.3-0.4 and the foot, including the longest toe, 0.5â€“0.6 of the SVL. Neither toe-tips nor finger-tips are enlarged. No traces of webbing. The skin is usually smooth, occasionally finely granular. Loveridge (1929) cites a female from Kenya with 52 mm SVL. Voucher specimens: SMNS 8963 1â€“14 + tadpoles; SMF 78649; ZFMK 68418 + 5 specimens.
Coloration: The snout is beige to dark olive. Yellow patches form a complex and highly variable meander pattern covering all of the dorsal part of the animal. Most often, brown and yellow pigments are equally distributed throughout. Rarely, one of these colors appears less conspicuous, so that yellow or black dots are scattered on a contrasting background. The vocal sac of the male is dark violet, whereas in the female, the throat shares the grayish-white color of the venter. Coloration in alcohol is almost equal to the live coloration, except that the frogs appear somewhat paler, and the colors usually turn to brown. On some animals, the mottled pattern of the back disappears completely so that the dorsum turns uniform brown or gray. The male throat either turns black, or it looses all its pigments. Finally, the neck fold loses definition in alcohol.
Voice: A loud buzzing call similar to the sound produced by crickets. Its frequency is around 4kHz. The call lasts 1.5â€“2 sec. The same call duration was reported by SchiÃ¸tz (1964c). He gives a dominant frequency that initially is 2.8 kHz, but quickly reaches a constant level of 3.1 kHz. The call comprises numerous pulses. In Nigeria animals uttered a warning vibration (SchiÃ¸tz 1963). Regarding the body dimensions given by SchiÃ¸tz, the latter observation most likely refers to H. guineensis. According to Amiet (1973a), the advertisement call is a shrill whistling sound.

Habitats: This species mainly inhabits savannas, but it is also found in gallery and island forests (Wake & Kluge 1961, Walker 1968, RÃ¶del et al. 1995). Walker (1968) found this species most often where the substrate was well-cultivated and irrigated. However, his report gives no clear indication as to whether this frog is actually more common in those habitats, or whether it is simply found more regularly because of the regular human activities. However, a preference for humid soils was equally observed by Poynton & Broadley (1985a) and Van Dijk (1982). On the contrary, Loveridge (1933) writes that he found the nests of this species at rather dry sites.
Range: According to Laurent (1972a) and Frost (1985), subspecies of H. marmoratus live all over the savanna regions south of the Sahara. The ComoÃ© National Park forms a part of the range of H. marmoratus sudanensis (Steindachner, 1863). According to Laurent (1972a), this subspecies inhabits an area south of the Sahara stretching from Senegal to Eritrea. For West Africa, he cites Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Chad. I found this subspecies in Burkina Faso, too (BÃ¶hme et al. 1996). According to Laurent (1972a) the range of the nominate subspecies considerably overlaps that of H. m. sudanensis. If the two subspecies should not cross-breed. H. sudanensis ought to be considered as a valid species. Otherwise the actual subspecies names should not be used any longer. I believe that reports from the following countries actually refer to H. marmoratus: Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, Namibia (Pfeffer 1893, Boulenger ?1906, 1910, LÃ¶nnberg 1910, Nieden 1915, Chabanaud 1919b, Loveridge 1925, 1929, 1930, 1936, 1942, 1955c, 1957, Parker 1930, Andersson 1937, Mertens 1955b, Wake & Kluge 1961, SchiÃ¸tz 1963 in part, 1964a in part, c, 1967 in part, Poynton 1964a, c, 1966, 1991, Lamotte 1966 in part, 1969, 1971, 1998, Barbault 1967, 1974d, Vuattoux 1968, Walker 1968, ?Euzet et al. 1969, ?Maeder 1969, Broadley 1971, 1991, Amiet 1973a, Stevens 1974, Lanza 1978, Poynton & Broadley 1985a, Frost 1985, Wager 1986, Branch 1988, Lambiris 1988, 1989, Channing 1989, Joger 1990, Channing & Griffin 1993, Simbotwe & Mubemba 1993, Pickersgill 1994, Passmore & Carruthers 1995, RÃ¶del et al. 1995, BÃ¶hme et al. 1996, RÃ¶del 1996, 1998b, Largen 1997a, c, Spieler 1997a, Kaminsky et al. 1999).

Biology: The diet nearly exclusively consists of ants and termites (e.g. Loveridge 1933, 1936, Andersson 1937, Lamotte 1967b, Barbault 1974d). The anatomy of the tongue and the mechanics of food intake have been analyzed by Ritter & Nishikawa (1995). H. marmoratus seems to be a predominantly subterranean species. Unlike most other burrowing species, which burrow by means of the metatarsal tubercles of their hind limbs (transformed into shovels), digging themselves backward rather slowly, Hemisus species invariably burrow head first, even when the male clasps his mate in inguinal amplexus. However, it is not sure whether these frogs are active or forage for prey below the surface. Although they are very likely to do so, we have not yet found evidence. H. marmoratus is encountered at the surface mainly at night, or immediately before or after rainfall when the air is saturated with humidity. This observation is confirmed by Poynton & Broadley (1985a). Otherwise, the frogs are hardly ever active at the surface.

During the first rainy nights, large numbers of shovel-nosed frogs will migrate to the vicinity of the ponds. Reproductive behavior starts long before the ponds are filled with water. Calling however, seems to be triggered by rain (RÃ¶del et al. 1995, Kaminsky et al. 1999). Quite regularly, amplectant pairs are already observed on these nights. Males are known to call both below ground and on the surface. In Namibia males call from the edge of pans during wet weather (Channing & Griffin 1993). The large number of solitary females arriving at the ponds most probably indicates that pairs are formed mainly at these sites. The hands and forearms of males apparently secrete sticky fluids so that pairs can be separated only by ""force"". Each pair will dig a burrow near the water, and the eggs are deposed in this subterranean refuge. Most probably, the males leave the burrow soon after. We found just a single cavity where a male was occupying a small chamber below the nest site (RÃ¶del et al. 1995). On the other hand, the females keep sitting on the clutch which would dry up otherwise. Eggs stuck on the back of the female (Passmore & Carruthers 1995) are almost certainly accidental. Rainfall is supposedly not the single factor triggering reproduction. For example, we found a nest in rather sandy soil, about 30 cm below the surface, long before the onset of the rainy season. The adjacent pond, separated from the nest by distance of about 5 m, was completely dry at that time. Tadpoles found in ponds that had been filled only hours ago unmistakably show that the reproductive activities of 
H. marmoratus can begin long before rainfall occurs (RÃ¶del et al. 1995).

Spawn: The eggs are deposited in subterranean burrows, with each clutch having a diameter of up to 4 cm and comprising 88â€“242 eggs. The unpigmented eggs have a diameter of 4.96â€“7.30 mm and are rich in yolk. The clutches are usually covered by a layer of infertile eggs. They are further covered by a layer that in appearance is similar to foam or parchment. The tadpoles hatch three to six days later, showing no traces of external gills. According to Kaminsky et al. (1999) the tadpoles hatch about one week after egg deposition. Wager (1986) reports approximately 200 eggs in a nest. In Tanzania, Loveridge (1933) found 110 tadpoles in a single nest.

Experiments have shown that the tadpoles may remain up to two months in those chambers. However, they can survive in open water at the age of some days (RÃ¶del et al. 1995, Kaminsky et al. 1999). As the time to be spent in the burrow is not fixed, they may react very rapidly and flexibly as soon as rainfall occurs. Therefore, they can reach the ponds before any other tadpoles hatch, and they begin their aquatic life larger than their competitors and most of their potential predators. This is especially important as very young H. marmoratus tadpoles seems to be extremely vulnerable to predators, whereas larger larvae have a much higher survival probability (RÃ¶del 1998b). However, the breeding season of H. marmoratus is not strictly restricted to the early phase of the rainy season. We found young larvae in the ponds throughout the rainy season, sometimes completely independent of actual rainfall (RÃ¶del et al. 1995).

Contrary to Amiet (1991c), the mother both ensures an adequate level of humidity and protection for the larvae. These are actively defended against intruders (RÃ¶del et al. 1995). When the mother was separated from the clutch, the tadpoles either desiccated, or they were eaten by ants. The tadpoles usually adhere to the mother as long as they remain in the burrow. Females carrying tadpoles have also been observed by Budgett (in Bliss 1907), Bourquin (1985) and VanDijk (1985). In the older literature, only one reproductive mode, based on a paper of Wager (1929), has been published for this species. The female was said to dig a subterranean tunnel to the nearest pond, thereby enabling the tadpoles to reach water (e.g. Wager 1929, 1986, Duellman & Trueb 1986, Lambiris 1989). At ComoÃ© National Park, we have succeeded in demonstrating that this phenomenon is virtually impossible in most breeding places. The banks of most ponds are so flat that long tunnels would be necessary to prevent the cavities from being inundated from the very beginning (RÃ¶del et al. 1995, Kaminsky et al. 1999). Some nests were situated from the nearest pond by distances of up to 100 m. Comparable situations found at ponds in South and East Africa have been described by Loveridge (1936), Van Dijk (1985), and Channing & Griffin (1993). For example Loveridge (1936) found a pair beneath the stem of a fallen coconut palm, and a female on an egg mass in similar conditions. He mentioned that the rainy season had just begun and the whole area seemed to become flooded in the course of a week or two. According to our data (RÃ¶del et al. 1995), the tadpoles seemed to be, at least in some cases, transported to the pond by their mother. The tadpoles found in the nests usually adhered to their mothers, and we encountered larvae in artificial concrete ponds where no tunnel could have been dug. Since 1995, I found additional tadpoles inhabiting rock-pools. In most cases, however, the female formed a superficial slide enabling the young to wriggle into the water (RÃ¶del et al. 1995, Kaminsky et al. 1999). Breeding chambers are even dug at the bottom of future ponds (Kaminsky et al. 1999). These nests are flooded after heavy rains. Most probably, shovel-nosed frogs follow highly variable strategies in response to the respective environment.

At ComoÃ© National Park, the tadpoles are found in any type of water, with the exception of the river ComoÃ©, e.g. in residuary puddles in the dry beds of brooks, savanna ponds of all sizes, and forest ponds. I even captured them in a brook on a rocky plateau. They may be found in any sector of these waters, but almost invariably near the bottom (RÃ¶del 1998b). In clear waters with dark bottom substrates, they are usually almost black. On the contrary, I have found white larvae in rather muddy water. These tadpoles are capable of changing their color within a few minutes. Most probably, their respective colors provide a certain degree of protection as the tadpoles have got to inhale atmospheric oxygen quite often. They are supposed to feed mainly on tiny algae and detritus. The highly variable sizes of metamorphosing tadpoles possibly indicate that the time when metamorphosis takes place is variable, so that they can minimize the risk of desiccation. (RÃ¶del, pers.com.)

In Lamto, Hemisus marmoratus was captured during the dry season in the soil below 2.6 % of all RÃ´nier palms, Borassus aethiopum. During June and July they reproduce in savanna ponds. During the rest of the year they live 15 cm beneath the soil at the feet of the palms. In January (dry season) one specimen was discovered 50 cm beneath the soil (Vuattoux 1968; RÃ¶del, pers.com.)

Tadpoles: Average length of hatching tadpoles is 11.1 mm (s.d. + 0.4 mm). This stage does not possess an oral disc. The rather elongate young larvae resemble tiny eels, with a large yellow yolk sac shimmering through the ventral skin. Several days pass before the differentiation of the oral disc is completed. This process proceeds more rapidly on tadpoles transferred to open water than on those which are left in the motherâ€™s burrow (RÃ¶del et al. 1995).
The complete keratodont formula reads 1 / 4+4 // 4 or 1 / 4+4 // 1+1 / 3. The oral disc is lined both laterally and caudally by one or two rows of short papillae touching the craniad border of the anterior teeth row. Some long cylindrical papillae are arranged in a caudad position, too. The horny teeth are elongate, and their distal ends bear tiny flat shovels with numerous tips.
Depending on the respective weather, the tadpoles either are transferred to the ponds within a few days, or they remain in the burrow for up to two months. Older larvae usually appear sturdier than younger stages. Rarely elongate individuals with almost parallel flanks have been sampled, too. The keratodont formula of the latter corresponds to that of the typical morph. The thickened base of the tail axis bears a black strip which stretches to the tip. This feature is just outlined in burrow stages. As for the rest, the coloration of the tadpoles is highly variable, depending most likely on the respective environment (compare below). Once in the pond, their development proceeds rapidly, especially during the first 8â€“10 days spent in water. Their hind limbs begin to emerge at a BL of 13.5â€“18.1 mm (TL: 41â€“53.3 mm). Metamorphosis sets in at a BL of 16 mm (SVL: 46mm). One of the largest tadpoles ever collected measured 20 mm (BL) and 56 mm (TL). In the humid residuary puddles of a brook, we found eight tadpoles whose TL amounted to more than 60 mm All these animals already possessed well developed hind limbs. The following exemplary data are meant to give an impression of the sizes-weight ratio (TL in mm / weight in g): 11.4/ 0.01; 16.6/ 0.02; 24/ 0.15; 30/ 0.28; 40/ 0.87; 53/ 0.85). Having spent three to four weeks in the water, the metamorphosed frogs measured 11.5 to 25 mm SVL. They leave the ponds to burrow themselves near the banks. Their coloration corresponds to that of their parents, being at most somewhat less contrasting. Some individuals even show uniform black backs, white bellies and grayish throats.

Wager (1986) and Lambiris (1988) give the following keratodont formula for tadpoles collected in South Africa: 2 / 3+3 // 1+1 / 3. The descriptions published by GuibÃ© & Lamotte (1958a), SchiÃ¸tz (1963) and Perret (1966) most probably relate to tadpoles of H. guineensis that are quite similar to the above-mentioned ones. Besides, Perret (1966) gives the keratodont formula of an obviously mutilated individual: 4+4 // 4+4. In Malawi, the young frogs leave the water after a period of six weeks (Stewart 1967).

This species was featured in news of the week 24 October 2022:
Changes to food webs can have unforeseen effects on other members of an ecosystem. Demare et al. (2022) documented how increased vegetation, presumably from the overhunting of large herbivorous mammals, changed the larval amphibian assemblage in tropical savannas in ComoÃ© National Park, Ivory Coast (Cote dâ€™Ivoire). Comparing surveys conducted before and after two civil wars, during which poaching caused vast reductions in large herbivorous mammals, the authors found significant increases in vegetation cover around ephemeral water bodies and a shift in dominant amphibian species in their larval form. The switch in amphibians favored species that use vegetation during breeding (Afrixalus spp., Hyperolius spp., and Hemisus marmoratus) and was detrimental to ground breeding species (Ptychadena spp.), which had previously been dominant. While increased vegetation likely provides more structure and food to aquatic systems, this shift was most closely correlated with the composition and structure of aquatic predators. It is unclear if this correlation is causal. However, this system provides a unique opportunity to better understand food web and ecosystem dynamics.  (Written by Ann Chang)

Acris crepitans is 1.6-3.5 cm long and has a blunt, pointed head with an occasional triangular marking.  Its back and legs are covered with various dark markings.  It has a middorsal bright green or brown stripe and the rear of its thigh has a distinct ragged dark stripe.  A white bar extends from its eye to its foreleg.  The body is slim-waisted and small while the skin is granular and warty.  Hind toes are extensively webbed and toe pads are poorly developed (Stebbins 2003).     
 
 
Acris crepitans paludicola and Acris crepitans blanchardi are recognized as subspecies.  A. c. paludicola  has smooth skin with a pinkish patterned coloration.  The throat remains pink, even for males during breeding season.  A. c. blanchardi by comparison is wartier, bulkier, and heavier with a light brown or gray uniform coloration (Conant and Collins 1991).   
 
 
Males have more ventral spotting than females (Stebbins 2003).   
 
 
 

","
Unlike most small frogs in its range, A. c. crepitans  does not leave the vicinity of water as an adult.  It is found at the edge of ponds and slow-moving streams, tending to avoid wooded areas and dense vegetation (Hulse McCoy and Censky 2001).   
 
A. c. blanchardi is found in Michigan, Ohio, Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and most of Texas.  A few have been spotted in Minnesota and New Mexico as well.  A. c. paludicola is found in marshes ranging from southwestern Louisiana to southeastern Texas (Conant and Collins 1991).   
 
 

","
Vocal calls are like the rapid clicking of pebbles, making a ""metallic gick gick gick"" sound. Rate of vocals is about 1 to 3 calls every second.  Breeding period usually lasts from April to July (Conant and Collins 1991).    Males can be seen calling from floating vegetation mats or from the banks of ponds.  Females seem to prefer males that call at a low pitch.   
 
It is active during both day and night in warm weather but only active during the day in spring and autumn.  Acris crepitans is an extraordinary leaper and can leap up to 38 times their standard body length (Hammerson 1999).        
 
 
It is carnivorous, eating various invertebrates and arthropods such as beetles, flies, spiders, ants, and true bugs (Hulse McCoy and Censky 2001).

Acris gryllus gryllus has a small body about 1.6-3.2cm long, a tapered snout, and anal warts.  The head is pointed and has a dark triangle between the eyes (Behler 1979).    A light bar extends from the eye to the forelimb.  The thigh is marked by a clean, dark stripe surrounded by distinct light stripes. The other subspecies Acris gryllus dorsalis is similar in size and appearance to A. g. gryllus, except that it has no anal warts and the rear of its thigh is marked by two dark lines.   
 
Males have a grayish chest and throat with a round vocal sac.  These body areas are usually more spotted in males than females (Stebbins 1954).   
 
Acris gryllus can be distinguished from other species of this genus by its longer hind legs and smaller degree of webbing on toes.  Specifically, the webbing does not reach the tip of the first toe (Conant and Collins 1991).  
","
A. g. gryllus ranges from southeastern Virginia to the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River, while A. g. dorsalis ranges from southwestern Georgia to Alabama and the southern tip of Florida.  Both are regularly terrestrial and lowland dwelling species, found in ponds, bogs, and river-bottoms.  Occasionally found in upland regions such as northern river valleys.  They favor grassy regions because vegetation offers protection (Conant and Collins 1991).   
 
Acris gryllus is not an able climber and therefore usually escapes danger by hopping around, leaping onto floating vegetation, or diving quickly to the bottom of a pond.  It is a hardy frog and abundant wherever it is found (Cochran 1970).    
","
Acris gryllus is diurnal.  It is especially active when startled.  As a strong jumper, it can jump up to 2-3 feet high, covering a horizontal length of 3-4 feet.   Diet consists of flying insects.    
  
 
Vocal call is a rapid succession of metallic ""gick gick gick's"" like a rattle.  Calls begin at a duration of 1 second intervals but begin to accelerate to a maximum of about 6 calls per second.  The clicking of two pebbles can induce  Acris gryllus to call.  A. g. gryllus breeds from February to October, depending on rainfall, while A. g. dorsalis can breed during any month.   
 
Breeding occurs in the water.  Females lay eggs one by one and attach them to the rocks and the vegetation of pond bottoms.  Eggs are dark brown or black with a tan colored bottom.  Tadpoles develop to be 1/2 inch long after about 7-13 weeks.  At this point, they are deep-bodied with a lower labium, indentations of a mouth, eyes, and an anus.  They are distinguished by a distinct black tipped tail (Behler 1979).

Agalychnis callidryas, the red-eyed tree frog, is a slender, colorful, medium-sized frog.  Females measure up to 77 mm, and males to 59 mm (Savage 2002).  This frog has leaf-green to dark green dorsal surfaces; dark blue, purple, or brownish flanks, with cream-colored or yellow vertical or diagonal bars; blue or orange upper arms; thighs that are blue or orange on the anterior, posterior, and ventral surfaces;  orange hands and feet, except for the outermost digits on each; a white ventrum; and protuberant red eyes, with vertical pupils 
 (Savage 2002; Leenders 2001; Duellman 2001).  The back is sometimes marked with faint tranverse darker green lines (especially in individuals from Nicaragua or Costa Rica) or small white dots  
(Duellman 2001).   The average number of bars on the flanks increases in populations from north to south, with a mean of 5.0 bars in Mexico and a mean of 9.0 bars in Panama  
(Duellman 2001).  In some populations from the middle part of the range (Nicaragua and Costa Rica, on the Caribbean side), there is often a continuous, longitudinal yellowish stripe connecting the upper ends of the vertical bars and separating the blue flanks from the green dorsum  
(Duellman 2001).  
 
The skin is smooth both dorsally and ventrally  
(Savage 2002). Agalychnis callidryas has a rounded head and a truncated snout when viewed from above  
(Duellman 2001).  Eyes are large and directed sideways  
(Leenders 2001).  When this frog closes its eyes, transparent lower eyelids marked with a network of gold are apparent  
(Leenders 2001). It has distinct tympana 
(Savage 2002). The body is slender and somewhat flattened  
(Leenders 2001).  Fingers are short, about one-half webbed, and have moderately large discs  
(Duellman 2001).  The toes are short, about two-thirds webbed, and also have moderately large discs that are nearly as large as those on the fingers, with a narrow fold running from the heel to the disc of the fifth toe  
(Duellman 2001; Savage 2002). Adult males have paired vocal slits and a single internal median subgular vocal sac, as well as a grayish brown spinose nuptial pad at the base of each thumb  
(Savage 2002).   
 
 Young froglets (at least from Panama) are able to change color; they are green by day and change to purplish or reddish brown at night  
(Pyburn 1963).  In addition, young froglets have yellow rather than red eyes, and have lighter-colored flanks lacking whitish bars  
(Pyburn 1963). The red eye coloration appears first at the periphery of the eye at about two weeks post-metamorphosis, and over a period of several days spreads inward to make the iris wholly red  
(Starrett 1960).  
 
Agalychnis callidryas tadpoles are large, with a robust body that can measure 48 mm in total length at stage 34  
(Savage 2002).  The tail and caudal fins are moderately sized, with the tail tip narrowing to a thin flagellum  
(Savage 2002).  The spiracle is sinistral and lateroventral, while the vent is dextral  
(Savage 2002).  Eyes and nostrils are dorsolateral  
(Savage 2002). The mouth is anteroventral, with a small and complete oral disk, serrated beaks, and two upper plus three lower rows of denticles  
(Savage 2002; Duellman 2001).  The row of denticles just above the mouth has a small gap medially 
(Savage 2002). Labial papillae are present on the lower lip in one to three rows lateral and ventral to the mouth, and on the upper lip in one to two rows lateral to the mouth, but lacking directly above the mouth  
(Duellman 2001).  The tadpole body is olive gray dorsally, shading into a bluish gray speckled with olive-brown on the sides and undersides   
(Duellman 2001).  Larval caudal musculature is a light grayish brown while the caudal fins are transparent, but both are speckled with dark gray 
 (Duellman 2001).  
 
 

","
Red-eyed tree frogs are distributed from Mexico (YucatÃ¡n) to Panama, with an isolated report from the Cartagena Botanic Gardens in Colombia  
(Savage 2002; Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996). They inhabit humid forests, primarily in lowlands and sometimes on premontane slopes up to 1,250 m  
(Leenders 2001).  
","
Agalychnis callidryas is nocturnally active.  This frog is arboreal and shelters on the underside of a broad leaf during the day and during the dry season, with limbs folded underneath its body (Leenders 2001).  It has also been found in bromeliads, though this appears to be rare (Duellman 2001). This species is abundant in suitable habitat (Stuart et al. 2008). 
         
 
Breeding occurs during the wet season (late May to November), beginning with the first rains (Pyburn 1970). Mating takes place throughout the rainy season but is particularly frequent in June, and occasionally peaks again in October (Donnelly and Guyer 1994).  Agalychnis callidryas generally prefers quiet pools of water with overhanging vegetation as breeding sites (but see the paragraph below for other types of sites used); the pools may be permanent, seasonal but long-lasting, or temporary (Warkentin et al. 2001; Pyburn 1970).  Males make aggressive calls, to deter other males from intruding onto their territories, and advertisement calls, to attract females  (Gray and Rand 1997).  The aggressive call sounds like a soft chuckle, and the advertisement call is a ""chack"" or ""chack-chack"", repeated at intervals of 8-60 seconds (Duellman 1967; Pyburn 1970; Duellman 2001).  The dominant call frequency ranges from 1.5-2.5 kHz  (Gray and Rand 1997). Calling begins at dusk and is most frequent in the evening, especially during rains, as males advertise for mates  
(Pyburn 1970).   However, Agalychnis callidryas have also been reported to participate in a brief daybreak chorus of advertisement calls, at a much higher call rate than evening or morning advertisement choruses  (Gray and Rand 1997; Duellman 2001).  On dry nights, males call from higher perches in the tree canopy (Pyburn 1970).  On wetter nights, or when the ponds are full, males begin calling from the ground and from small trees and bushes near the edges of ponds or backwaters (Pyburn 1970).  Calls are generally made from horizontal perches on leaves or branches, although vertical perches on stems are occasionally used (Pyburn 1970).  Males move about frequently while calling, changing both their positions and the direction of calling  (Pyburn 1970).  If precipitation or water level conditions are sufficient, males then descend to the breeding sites at the water's edge and continue calling (Savage 2002).  Females descend from the canopy, approach selected calling males in a straight line, and allow amplexus to take place (Pyburn 1970). Descent generally occurs slowly hand-over-hand, but parachuting has also been observed in this species, both in the wild (Pyburn 1964), and in experimental trials  
(Roberts 1994).  
 
Once amplexed, a female will carry the amplectant male into the water and remain there for about ten minutes (Pyburn 1970; D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  Pyburn  (1970) carried out experiments showing that the purpose of this behavior is to allow the female to absorb water through her skin, into her bladder, in order to make the jelly mass surrounding the clutch of eggs (Pyburn 1970). The amplectant pair then moves up into the trees, as the female searches for an appropriate egg deposition site on vegetation overhanging the water (Pyburn 1970; D'Orgeix and Turner 1995). Eggs are generally deposited on either the upper side (Pyburn 1970) or lower side (Fouquette 1968) of a broad leaf, as high as 12 feet over the water (Fouquette 1968). Sturdy plants and trees at the water's edge are preferred, but oviposition may also take place on emergent vegetation (Pyburn 1970). Egg clutches may also occasionally be deposited on substrates such as branches or fence wire (Pyburn 1970).  Very rarely eggs will be deposited on the ground  (Pyburn 1970).  This species has also been reported to sometimes make use of a wide variety of other types of sites, such as water-filled depressions made by human and pack animals, completely lacking overhanging vegetation; vines and small trees overhanging cavities of water in fallen trees; passionflower vines growing above a trickle of water from a pig pen; or by attaching eggs to the inside surface of water collection devices  (McCranie et al. 2003).  Occasionally clutches are found with leaves partially or completely folded over the eggs (Duellman 2001). If the deposition site is on top of a leaf, the parents may be protecting the clutch from sun and predators by folding the leaf edge over, where it adheres to the sticky jelly mass surrounding the eggs (Leenders 2001).  Other leaf-breeding frogs (Phyllomedusa iheringi, P. hypochondrialis, and P. sauvagii) protect their clutches within folded leaves (Pyburn 1970).  However,  Duellman (2001) cautions that for Agalychnis callidryas, the occasional folding may be due to attachment of the eggs to particular types of leaves more prone to curling, as neither he nor others (e.g. Pyburn) have observed this species actively curling leaves during oviposition. Pyburn  (1970), in fact, specifically mentions that Agalychnis callidryas lays its eggs on open leaves, in contrast to other phyllomedusine frogs. 
 
Fertilization occurs immediately after egg deposition (Leenders 2001).  Occasionally amplectant pairs are attacked by single males, as the intruder attempts to dislodge the first male or attach himself alongside or on the first male's back (Pyburn 1970; D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  This strategy sometimes succeeds, as molecular analysis has confirmed that multiple paternity does occur and that the second male can contribute significantly to clutch fertilization in the wild  (D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  Briggs (2008) conducted male-displacement trials, where a male at least 5 mm longer in SVL was placed into a covered 5-gallon bucket with a recently amplexed pair and checked every hour with red light, but found no male takeovers occurred.  Over a three-year study period, Briggs (2008) reported that mating patterns varied; red-eyed tree frogs showed evidence of size-assortative mating in one of the three years and evidence of large-male mating advantage in another one of the three years (the driest year). 

Clutches consist of about 40 green eggs, each surrounded by a clear jelly coat, with each egg having a diameter of about 3.7 mm at oviposition and 5.2 mm when mature enough to hatch (Pyburn 1963; Warkentin 2000a; Warkentin 2002).  The entire clutch is itself surrounded in more jelly, which is sticky and serves to adhere the clutch to the substrate as well as to prevent desiccation (Pyburn 1963; Pyburn 1970; Warkentin et al. 2006). Yolk color is consistent within clutches, but varies between clutches, from cream to gold to turquoise to lime green  (Warkentin et al. 2006); as the clutches get older, the yolk changes color from pale green to yellow  (Duellman 2001). Females may lay multiple clutches (up to five) in a single night (Pyburn 1970).  In between clutches, the female carries the amplectant male down into the water again as she rehydrates (D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  Ovulation is likely to occur twice during the reproductive season, given that gravid females containing ovulated eggs were also found to have equal numbers of immature half-size eggs still within the ovary, (Duellman 1963; Duellman 2001). This observation also fits with the second peak in mating sometimes observed near the end of the rainy season  (Donnelly and Guyer 1994).  Fertilization success is high, with Briggs (2008) noting 100% fertilization in 54 of 56 experimental clutches and reporting that this did not differ from her field observations. 
 
Since the egg clutches are attached to vegetation overhanging the water, hatching tadpoles generally fall into the water below as soon as they hatch (Pyburn 1963). Thus hatching involves a shift in habitat, from aerial to aquatic, with a concomitant change in the suite of potential predators and selection pressures  (Warkentin 1995). Occasionally, hatching tadpoles may also fall onto the ground (Pyburn 1970).  Tadpoles are able to live out of water for up to 20 hours (Valerio 1971). Those that fall onto the ground or remain stuck to the leaf may still survive if a later rain washes them into standing water, or if they are able to flip themselves into the water by thrashing about with their tails  (Pyburn 1963; Pyburn 1970).  
 
 Agalychnis callidryas shows remarkable adaptive plasticity in the timing of hatching (Warkentin 1995). In undisturbed clutches, embryos develop essentially synchronously but hatch asynchronously, from six to ten days post-oviposition (Warkentin 1995; Warkentin 2005).  Most undisturbed embryos will hatch at about seven days, with the study population in Panama hatching on average at about 6 - 7 days and the study population in Costa Rica hatching at about 7 - 8 days (Warkentin 2005). However, if disturbed, Agalychnis callidryas embryos can undergo early, relatively synchronous hatching, as early as 4 days in Panama  (Warkentin 2000b) or 5 days in Costa Rica  (Warkentin 1995).  Accelerated hatching can occur in entire clutches or small groups of eggs within a clutch, in response to at least four different natural risks: snake attack (Warkentin 1995), wasp attack (Warkentin 2000b), fungus infestation  
(Warkentin et al. 2001), and flooding or submersion (Pyburn 1963; Warkentin 2002). Hypoxia from exposure to hypoxic gas mixtures also induces early hatching  (Warkentin 2002). Fungal attack, flooding, and hypoxia result in more gradual early hatching than immediate threat of predation (Warkentin 2000b). 

The decision to hatch is a behavioral decision since highly energetic movement is required; embryos that remain motionless do not hatch, even though they have reached an appropriate developmental stage  (Warkentin 1995; Warkentin et al. 2001). Mechanical disturbance is both sufficient and necessary to induce rapid, synchronous hatching, since simultaneous touching and jiggling of the eggs by poking forceps into the surrounding jelly results in rapid hatching  
(Warkentin 1995). However, Agalychnis callidryas embryos do not respond to all mechanical disturbances by rapid hatching (Warkentin 1995). Five-day-old embryos are insensitive to movements of the leaf substrate caused by simply touching the egg jelly coats, or collecting and transporting egg clutches, or even high winds and heavy rain  (Warkentin 1995).  The plasticity in timing and synchronization of hatching, particularly early hatching, is thus not simply a response to mechanical stimulus intensity (Warkentin 2000b), nor is it a response to visual or chemical cues from  snake or wasp predators, or cues such as wetting of the clutch from precipitation (Warkentin 2005).  Rather, experiments have shown that red-eyed tree frog embryos assess the temporal pattern of substrate-borne vibrations when making the decision to hatch  (Warkentin 2005; Warkentin et al. 2006; Warkentin et al. 2007).  Further, they do not hatch at the earliest possible moment following stimulation, but wait some seconds to minutes to evaluate the information before deciding to hatch  (Warkentin et al. 2007). 
  
Cohen et al. (2016) showed that arboreal embryos of Agalychnis callidryas can hatch very rapidly (6.5 - 49 seconds) in order to escape from snake attacks.  They identified three stages of hatching: pre-rupture shaking and gaping, vitelline membrane rupture near the snout, and muscular thrashing to escape. Electron microscopy revealed hatching glands densely clustered on the snout that are filled with vesicles that release their contents rapidly at hatching. Characterization of the postulated hatching enzyme remains to be accomplished. Comparative studies of the glands should reveal differences among taxa to determine whether this or other novel mechanisms are employed. 

A video clip is available of Agalychnis callidryas embryos undergoing accelerated hatching resulting from snake attack.  Developing Agalychnis callidryas embryos are commonly preyed on by snakes (e.g., Leptodeira septentrionalis)  (Warkentin 1995). Snake attack induces embryos to hatch up to 30% early (as early as five days post-oviposition), rapidly (within seconds to minutes), and relatively synchronously, as the entire clutch hatches within a few minutes rather than over several days 
(Warkentin 1995).  Embryos are able to distinguish between the potentially lethal event of a snake attack and the relatively non-dangerous event of a rainstorm by the duration and timing of resulting vibrations  (Warkentin et al. 2006). When vibrational recordings produced by a snake attack or by a rainstorm are edited and played back, such that the timing of vibrations more closely resembles the other stimulus, the hatching response shifts in the expected direction: higher for more snakelike vibrations, lower for more rain-like vibrations (Warkentin et al. 2006). Tadpoles first enter the water on hatching, shifting their habitat from aerial to aquatic as they fall from from the overhanging leaves to which the egg clutch was attached  (Pyburn 1963). If undisturbed by snakes, embryos tend to delay hatching until they are about seven days old, because more developed larvae are less vulnerable to aquatic predators such as shrimp and fish  (Warkentin 1995; Warkentin 2005).    
 
Developing Agalychnis callidryas embryos are also frequently vulnerable to predation by several different species of polybid wasps 
(Warkentin 2000b; Warkentin et al. 2006). Wasp predation, like snake predation, induces early and rapid hatching of Agalychnis callidryas embryos  
(Warkentin 2000b). Interestingly, the number of embryos hatching is different, depending on the predation scenario. Warkentin  
(2000b) reports that embryos hatch individually or in small groups (the ones grasped by a wasp, plus sometimes the nearest neighbors) in response to wasps, which consume a single embryo at a time, whereas whole clutches hatch in response to snakes, which eat entire clutches. A video featuring Karen Warkentin's work is available.
 
Fungal infection of Agalychnis callidryas egg clutches by a filamentous ascomycete (family Phaeosphaeriaceae) also induces early hatching  
(Warkentin et al. 2001).  While eggs in non-infected clutches hatch in a spatially random order, hatching in infected clutches is non-random  
(Warkentin et al. 2001).  In infected clutches, those eggs which are specifically in direct contact with fungal hyphae will hatch early if they are at least five days old (Warkentin et al. 2001). Adjacent empty eggs can form a ""barrier"" which the fungus does not typically cross, allowing the remaining embryos to continue developing within the clutch (Warkentin et al. 2001). In contrast to the immediate, synchronous hatching in response to snake or wasp attack, fungus-infected clutches that are  at a sufficient stage of development hatch over a period of days, but at an average younger age than healthy clutches (Warkentin et al. 2001). 
 
Agalychnis callidryas larvae have unusually large, elaborate external gills for anurans, consisting of a gill trunk on each side of the body, with one row of branched filaments (Pyburn 1963).  The presence of large, elaborate gills is likely to indicate oxygen limitation throughout development, especially since the embryos of this species develop in large, closely packed eggs under quite warm conditions (Warkentin 2000a). Larvae show strikingly rapid external gill loss on hatching, with substantial gill regression occurring as fast as three minutes post-hatching (Warkentin 2000a). Newly hatched tadpoles respire via internal gills, as well as cutaneously (Warkentin 2000a). The increase in environmentally available oxygen upon leaving the egg has been experimentally demonstrated to be the primary stimulus for external gill loss in this species, with the process of hatching itself playing a secondary role in triggering gill loss (Warkentin 2000a).  Since the presence of external gills creates drag in the water (Dudley et al. 1991), rapid gill loss at the time these tadpoles first enter the water may enhance swimming performance, which could enable survival on exposure to aquatic predators  
(Warkentin 2000a).  In this species (and probably other anurans with external gills), the loss of external gills at hatching appears to be mediated by prostaglandins of the E family, or PGEs  (Warkentin and Wassersug 2001). In contrast, the loss of internal gills is mediated by thyroid hormone at the time of metamorphosis  (Shi 2000).  
    
Tadpoles of Red-Eyed Tree Frogs suspend themselves vertically in the water column to feed, with heads near the water surface (Savage 2002).  They are primarily water-column filter feeders (Vonesh and Warkentin 2006).  Gray and Nishikawa (1995) reported that in the laboratory, adult Agalychnis callidryas preferred crickets and moths as prey. To our knowledge, no field study has yet been published on the diet of adults of this species. 
 
Eggs of Agalychnis callidryas are vulnerable to predation by arboreal snakes (such as the cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira septentrionalis), several species of polybid wasps (particularly Polybia rejecta), monkeys, and fly larvae (Hirtodrosophila batracida) 
 
(Warkentin 1995; Warkentin 2000b; Warkentin et al. 2001; Warkentin et al. 2006). In addition, eggs are susceptible to mortality from fungal infection by a filamentous ascomycete (family Phaeosphaeriaceae)  
(Warkentin et al. 2001). Tadpoles may be preyed on by aquatic predators such as shrimp (Macrobrachium americanum) and fish (Brachyraphis rhabdophora)  
(Warkentin 1995), as well as giant water bugs foraging below the water surface (Belostoma sp.) 
(Vonesh and Warkentin 2006). Newly metamorphosed froglets may be consumed by aquatic spiders foraging at or above the water surface (Thaumasia sp.) 
(Vonesh and Warkentin 2006). Predators on juvenile and adult Red-Eyed Tree Frogs include snakes (Warkentin 1995), as well as birds and bats  
(Leenders 2001).   
 
Although phyllomedusine (leaf-breeding) frogs do not have the same sort of highly toxic compounds as other brightly colored frogs such as the dendrobatids, their skin does contain high levels of biologically active peptides (Mignogna et al. 1997). The skin of Agalychnis callidryas has been shown to contain five different families of biologically active peptides: tachykinins, bradykinins, caerulein, opioid peptides (dermorphin and [Hyp6]dermorphin), and sauvagine  
(Mignogna et al. 1997).   

In addition to larvae being able to sense vibrations, it has now been shown that adult male Red-Eyed Tree Frogs also use vibrational signaling, in  male-male aggressive interactions (Caldwell et al., 2010). The authors point out that substrate vibrations may be far more important in communication by arboreal vertebrates than had previously been realized.  
During contests over females, male Red-Eyed Tree Frogs emit ""chuckle"" calls and perform tremulation displays by shaking a branch rapidly with their hind legs. Tremulations only occurred when two males were within 2 m of each other or were on the same plant, and were often immediately followed by wrestling. To test whether the vibrations were important, various combinations of displays were made using a robotic frog on a wooden frame near a branch occupied by a live frog, plus a shaker on the branch where the live frog sat.  In some tests, the robotic frog moved up and down, for a visual display, but no branch shaking was done; in others, the branch was vibrated but the robotic frog did not move; and in some tests, both visual and vibrational displays were made.  The live males responded aggressively to all displays, both visual and vibrational, but only shook their own branch when vibrations were felt from the shaker (Caldwell et al. 2010).

This species can tolerate some habitat modification, such as in areas where selective logging has been done, but is thought not to be able to live where the forest has been heavily degraded  
(Stuart et al. 2008). However, McCranie et al.  
(2003) report finding Agalychnis callidryas eggs and tadpoles in a wide variety of breeding sites in Honduras, including some in heavily deforested areas (see Life History section above for a description).  

All five Agalychnis species (A. annae, A. callidryas, A. moreletii, A. saltator, and A. spurrelli) are now under CITES protection, under Appendix II (as of March 21, 2010). Within the past decade the U.S. alone has imported 221,960 Agalychnis frogs, according to the Species Survival Network (SSN).   
","
Red-eyed tree frogs are popular in the pet trade, and can be bred in captivity under suitable conditions.

The diploid number of chromosomes is 26 for Agalychnis callidryas (Duellman and Cole 1965).  

This species was featured in News of the Week 4 April 2022:
The evolutionary transition to terrestriality and terrestrial breeding in amphibians has occurred repeatedly, but have the required key adaptations, e.g., resistance to desiccation and toxic ammonia build-up, likewise been repeated? MÃ©ndez-NarvÃ¡ez and Warkentin (2022) examined this question in a comparative study of four frog lineages, contrasting either short (Agalychnis callidryas, Engystomops pustulosus) or long (Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni, Leptodactylus fragilis) larval exposure to desiccating conditions. They carried out experiments in an open lab in the rainforests of Gamboa, Panama (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution). By manipulating environmental conditions (wet vs. dry) and tracking levels of ammonia and urea excretion, they evaluated the tolerance to ammonia exhibited by larvae of each species. They found the two species (H. fleischmanni, L. fragilis) which experience the highest risk of desiccation showed clear evidence for urea production and for pronounced increases in urea excretion, whereas the other two did not. Without urea excretion, the larvae of the high-risk species could experience lethal conditions, providing a clear case for the adaptive value of urea production in these species. They also compared the two foam-nesting species (E. pustulosus, L. fragilis) and two leaf-breeding species (H. fleischmanni, A. callidryas), demonstrating the similar changes in nitrogen metabolism in response to desiccation risk in both comparisons. Their study provides important evidence for the potentially key role of adaptive plasticity in mediating major evolutionary changes. (by Kyle Summers)

Diagnosis: Agalychnis lemur can be distinguished from other Costa Rican green treefrogs by having a vertical pupil and lacking digital webbing (Savage 2002).

Description: Agalychnis lemur is a moderately-sized green treefrog, with adult males measuring 30-41 mm in SVL and adult females measuring 39-53 mm in SVL.  The head is equally broad as long, with a short, truncate snout when viewed from above and a vertical snout in lateral view.  Eyes are large, with a lower eyelid that lacks reticulation.  The tympanum is distinct and moderately-sized, with a diameter no more than half the diameter of the eye.  Fingers have small discs, with the disc on Finger III slightly wider than the tympanum.  Single subarticular tubercles are present.  Thenar pad is moderately enlarged and the palmar tubercle is small, rounded, and flattened.  A weak ulnar fold runs from the elbow to the tip of Finger IV.  Toes usually lack webbing, or at most have slight webbing between Toes III and IV.  Toe V has a slight outer fringe. Weakly developed plantar tubercles are present. The inner metatarsal tubercle is low and elliptical, while the outer metatarsal tubercle is absent.  No distinct tarsal fold is present.  Heel occasionally has a single tiny tubercle but no calcar or well-developed heel tubercle is present. The dorsum is smooth and the venter is granular. Adult males have a single, barely distensible internal median subgular vocal sac, with two elongate paired vocal slits, and a brownish non-spinous nuptial pad on the base of each thumb (Savage 2002).

Coloration in life: This species exhibits metachrosis. Dorsal surfaces are generally pale green by day and various shades of reddish brown, lavender brown, or orange tan by night.  Forearm is dark yellow on the upper surface.  Anterior and posterior thigh surfaces are orange.  Flanks are yellow to orange.  Venter is a creamy white.  Iris is silvery white (Savage 2002).
","
This species occurs in Costa Rica and Panama, and marginally in Colombia. Populations of this species now occur only in a few localities in Costa Rica, including Fila AsunciÃ³n, 15 km southwest of LimÃ³n (an abandoned farm); in a forested area near Parque Nacional Barbilla in Cartago and LimÃ³n; and GuayacÃ¡n (in LimÃ³n Province). Agalychnis lemur is generally found in humid lowland and montane primary forests. It is not associated with degraded habitats. The eggs are usually deposited on leaf surfaces and the larvae are washed off or fall into water below the site of oviposition. Its altitudinal range is 440 - 1,600 m asl (Stuart et al. 2008).
","
Agalychnis lemur is a nocturnal tree frog, active throughout most of the year. It sleeps on the undersides of leaves during the day, and begins activity after dusk. It rarely jumps but is usually a slow climber on leaves or twigs. This frog approaches its prey slowly and pounces from about 50 to 60 mm away, while continuing to grip the perch with its feet (Savage 2002). 

Advertisement calls consist of a very short ""tick"" repeated every 25 seconds. Call durations are 190 - 200 milliseconds, with 39 - 41 pulses per second.  This species is territorial and A. lemur will emit an encounter call of 2 - 4 pulses when another male is nearby. A release call can also be produced.  Males are aggressive in defending their territory, with resident males clasping intruder males and unreceptive females and trying to push them off the perch (Savage 2002). 

Reproductive season is concentrated in the rainy months between April to July (Savage 2002). Amplectant pairs lay eggs generally onto the top of leaf surfaces above water (Savage 2002). In captivity, clutches consisted of 15 to 30 green eggs (Savage 2002); at RÃ­o Blanco, Limon, Costa Rica, field-laid clutches consisted of 22.5 +/- 2.1 eggs (N=4) (Gomez-Mestre et al. 2008).  Females may produce two or three clutches in one night or may lay clutches on separate nights (Savage 2002). Egg masses are deposited in a single layer or double layer (Savage 2002), with clutch thickness measuring 7.1 +/-0.3 mm (Gomez-Mestre et al. 2008). Eggs measure 3.0 to 3.5 mm in diameter, inside gelatinous capsules of 5 -6 mm in diameter (Savage 2002). Hatching occurs 7 -14 days after fertilization (Savage 2002). Embryos are light green and fall into the water below or are washed there by rain (Savage 2002). 

Metamorphosis takes place 69 - 98 days post-fertilization, when green pigment first develops.  Metamorphs also show metachrosis (color changes between day and night), but lack the orange or yellow flank coloration (Savage 2002).
","
Moderately sized tadpole, with stage 30 larvae measuring about 42 mm in total length.  The body is ovoid, with a moderate tail having reduced tail fins and a pointed tip.  Eyes are dorsolateral and directed laterally. Nares are dorsolateral and directed anterolaterally. The mouth is anteroventral, with a small, entire oral disc, serrated beaks, and 2/3 rows of denticles.  A2 has a slight median gap.  Two or three rows of papillae are present, lateral and ventral to the mouth (Savage 2002).  

Coloration: The tadpole's body is purple-gray, with a creamy yellow venter suffused with pink.  Dark flecks and mottling are present on the venter, flanks and tail musculature.  The fins are mostly transparent but have some dark flecking on the anterior.  The larval iris is gold (Savage 2002).

Larvae are suspension-raspers, feeding both in the water column and on the bottom (Savage 2002).
","
This species is uncommon and has suffered massive declines, likely from chytridiomycosis. Brem and Lips (2008) reported that A. lemur had disappeared by 2003 from a transect in Parque Nacional Santa Fe, Panama, where it was formerly common; this area experienced a major chytridiomycosis outbreak in 2003, with multiple species vanishing and/or declining significantly in numbers.  Recent studies by Woodhams et al. (2006) found that among the species they studied, A. lemur showed somewhat more resistance to infection with chytridiomycosis. However, by 2010, A. lemur could no longer be found in El CopÃ©, Panama (Lips, personal communication).

Agalychnis lemur has successfully been bred in captivity by the Atlanta Zoo, which has distributed hundreds of F1 offspring to multiple facilities in three different countries (Gagliardo et al. 2008).

Species authority: Boulenger (1882). 

Originally placed in the genus Phyllomedusa, subsequently into Hylomantis by Faivovich et al. (2005), and most recently Agalychnis (Faivovich et al. 2010). 

Agalychnis lemur is a member of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae. Phyllomedusine frogs produce many skin-secreted peptides, with more than 80 peptides from this group characterized as having antimicrobial activity (Amiche et al. 2008).  A. lemur has also proven to be a rich source of skin-secreted peptides with differential cytolytic activity.  Three of its skin-secreted peptides have been characterized: phylloseptin-L1 shows inhibition of growth of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and inhibition of the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (Conlon et al. 2007); dermaseptin-L1 shows inhibition of growth of Bd and of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, or E. coli (Conlon et al. 2007); and phylloseptin-L2, which was shown to stimulate insulin release in rat cells (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2008).   Phylloseptin-L2 might thus be valuable to develop into a therapeutic agent for treating Type 2 diabetes (Abdel-Wahab et al. 2008).  In addition, dermaseptin-L1 showed fivefold greater selectivity for HepG2 human hepatoma-derived neoplastic cells over erythrocytes, suggesting that this particular peptide might also have potential for engineering as an anti-cancer agent (Conlon et al. 2007).  Because A. lemur's peptides have potential anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and anti-diabetes functions (and so few of the peptides it produces have yet been studied), it should be considered an important species in human medicinal research and priority should be given to conservation of its rapidly disappearing population (Conlon et al. 2007). 

Karyotype is 2N = 26 (LeÃ³n 1969).

Agalychnis saltator is a relatively small red-eyed frog, with adult males ranging from 34 to 54 mm and the larger females ranging from 57 to 66 mm.  This frog can be identified by its red eyes with vertical pupils, and its orange hands and feet.  They have extensive webbing between the fingers and toes and large suction disks at end of each digit  
(Leenders 2001).  The adults are light or dark leaf green with some individuals having one to several raised yellow spots on their dorsal side.  The sides of the body and anterior and posterior surface of the thighs are bluish purple.  Their iris color can range from orange to tomato red.  Their ventral side are cream anteriorly with a yellow or orange tint posteriorly.  Other than the size difference between the males and females, males develop a dark or black patch on the inside of the base of the thumb during mating season  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  This species closely resembles Agalychnis callidryas (red-eyed leaf frog) but with some differences.  It has a uniform dark blue or purple flanks instead of vertical white, yellow, or cream bars found in the red-eyed leaf frog.  Another difference is that Agalychnis saltator changes its color from uniform leaf-green during the day to tan or brown during the night, while the red-eyed leaf frog just change their hue 
(Leenders 2001).  
 

","
This red-eyed leaf frog occurs in the humid lowlands of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  It is found in the same areas as Agalychnis callidryas  
(Leenders 2001).  They inhabit swamps during the mating season (wet season) and canopy trees in primary forest during the dry season  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005). 
","
During the mating season, these tree frogs breed on vines that overhang temporary ponds in forested areas (Leenders 2001).  Males give off a short,soft, high pitched ""peep"" or ""chirp"" at the breeding site.  The call has a long interval which can last up to 30 seconds.  Calls are made from the perch of the trees around the breeding sites  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  They only mate after periods of heavy precipitation.  Eggs are laid on mosses that cover the vines.  It is during this time that the frogs are most prone to predation.  Ants have been observed preying on the frog eggs. Various species of snakes feed on both eggs and adults.  They are known as the parachuting red-eyed leaf frog because in order to move rapidly to mating grounds, males leap from considerable height to leaves of a plant.  While jumping, this frogs extends its limbs and spreads out the skin between its fingers and toes  
(Leenders 2001).

","
All five Agalychnis species (A. annae, A. callidryas, A. moreletii, A. saltator, and A. spurrelli) have just received CITES protection, under Appendix II (as of March 21, 2010). Within the past decade the U.S. alone has imported 221,960 Agalychnis frogs, according to the Species Survival Network (SSN).

The snout-vent length is 48.2 to 56.4 mm in adult males from Costa Rica and 60.2 to 71.8 mm in adult females from Costa Rica (Duellman 2001).  Panamanian individuals are larger, with males measuring 67.6-75.6 mm and females 81.6 to 86.7 mm, and one female from Colombia measuring 92.8 mm (Duellman 2001).  The head is as broad as it is long, with a snout that is subelliptical when viewed from above.  The eyes are large, with reticulated lower eyelids.  The diameter of the tympanum is equal to about one-half diameter of the eye (Savage 2002).  The tympanum is moderately distinct, with the upper and posterior edges covered by a dermal fold (Duellman 2001)  This dermal fold runs from the posterior of the eye over the tympanum, and continues as a flap to the axilla (Duellman 2001).  The body is thin (Duellman 2001).  Dorsally the skin is smooth, as are the ventral surfaces of the limb, while the belly and proximal ventral surfaces of the thigh are granular (Duellman 2001).  Upper arms are slender but forearms are robust, with a noticeable dermal fold running across the elbow and along the ventrolateral edge of the forearm down to the disc of finger IV (Duellman 2001).  The fingers and toes have discs (Duellman 2001). Fingers are about 3/4 webbed; toes are fully webbed in Panamanian specimens but slightly less so in 
Costa Rican specimens (Duellman 2001).  Savage (2002) reported the webbing formula for fingers as I 2--2 II 1-1 Â¾ III 1-1 IV and for toes as I 1-2- II 1-2- III 1-1 Â½ IV 1 Â½ - IV.  There are flattened, bifid subarticular tubercles under fingers III and IV (Duellman 2001). The thenar tubercle is greatly enlarged but the palmar tubercle is not present.  On the hindlimbs, skin on the shank tends to form a thin longitudinal fold on the ventrolateral and ventromedian surfaces, and a thin dermal fold extends across the heel and along the outer edge of the tarsus to the base of the disc on the fifth toe (Duellman 2001). There is a strong tarsal fold extending the entire length of the tarsus (Duellman 2001).  On the posteroventral surfaces of the thighs, a distinct row of granules is present (Duellman 2001). There are many plantar tubercles, and supernumerary tubercles on proximal segments of the toes (Duellman 2001).   The inner metatarsal tubercle is low and elliptical, and there is no outer metatarsal tubercle.  In adult males, there are spiny, brown nuptial pads on the base of the thumb, as well as short, paired vocal slits and a slightly distensible single median subgular vocal sac (Savage 2002). 

The color of the frog changes from day to night (metachrosis).  During the day, dorsal surfaces of the head, body, limbs, fourth fingers, and fourth and fifth toes are light, yellowy green, turning darker green at night.  Dorsal surfaces often have black-bordered white, pustular spots; this species is the only Agalychnis species in which the white spots may have black outlines, and the black borders seem to be present in all Panamanian and Colombian specimens but lacking in some Costa Rican specimens (Duellman 2001).  The upper surfaces of the forearms, flanks, belly, anterior and posterior thigh surfaces, webbing, and most digits are orange (Duellman 2001).  Individuals from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, had a yellow chin and throat, while those from Tacarcuna, Panama had a creamy white throat and chest, and those from the Peninsula de Osa, Costa Rica, had a cream throat the chest and a pale orange belly (Duellman 2001).   In some individuals there is a dark green stripe separating the green dorsum from the orange flanks (Duellman 2001).  Yellowish cream stripes run from the elbow to the disc of finger IV, along the edge of the tarsus from the heel to the disc of toe V, and across the anal flap (Duellman 2001). The iris is dark red, and the palpebral reticulations are greenish gold.  Juveniles are green during the day but reddish brown at night (Savage 2002).  
	

The length of the larva is 41 mm at stage 35.  The body is robust and the tail is moderate, its tip tapering to a thin flagellum.  Eyes are located dorsolaterally and directed laterally.  Nares are dorsolateral, directed anteriorly (Savage 2002).  The mouth is anteroventral, with a small and entire oral disc that has beaks and 1/3 rows of denticles (Savage 2002).  Both beaks are serrated, and there are two or three rows of papillae lateral and ventral to the mouth. The spiracle is lateroventral and sinistral, and the vent is dextral. The body coloration is bluish gray with dark brown flecks on the sides and the anterior portion of the fins.  The caudal musculature is reticulated brown and gray anteriorly (Savage 2002).

","
This species is found in tropical and subtropical humid lowlands, as well as the lower portions of premontane zones of southeastern and southwestern Costa Rica, through Panama, the Pacific lowlands of Colombia and northwestern Ecuador, at elevations ranging from 15-750 m (Savage 2002; Jungfer et al. 2008).  It is also found in inland intermittent freshwater marshes and pools smaller than 8 ha (Sutart et al. 2008).

","
Agalychnis spurrelli is a nocturnal, arboreal canopy-dwelling species, with unusual methods of locomotion (Savage 2002).  It moves through the canopy by climbing vines and branches using a hand-over-hand locomotion.  It also parachutes while leaping, to move horizontally (Savage 2002).  The parachuting leaps are accomplished by spreading out the hands and feet so that the frog's large, extensively webbed feet are parallel to the substrate (Savage 2002).  The frog can maintain an angle of descent up to 45Âº from the vertical for considerably long distances (Savage 2002).  It can also execute turns during the descent, about 2 m from the ground (Duellman 2001).  



Gliding Leaf Frog: slow motion gliding footage (fast forward 1 minute)

This species is associated with temporary ponds with dense foliage hanging over the water, where explosive breeding takes place (IUCN 2006).  Breeding occurs with the rainy season, usually May through October.  It breeds in woodland pools and water-filled cavities in logs (Duellman 2001).  Male calls are described by Savage (2002) as a ""single, low-pitched moan"" repeated every 10 to 17 seconds, and by Scott and Starrett (1974) as a very weak, sometimes erratic ""Wuk! Wuk! Wuk!"".  Call duration is 340 to 400 milliseconds with a pulse rate of 60 to 90 per second.  The dominant frequency is 0.44 to 0.7 kHz (Duellman 2001). 
Females lay egg masses on leafy foliage, mostly 1.5 - 3 m above the water but as high as 8 m (Scott and Starrett 1974).  Egg masses are generally deposited on the upper side of the leaf (Duellman 2001). Clutches vary in size from 14-67 eggs each (Scott and Starrett 1974).  Males have been observed scraping eggs off the leaves with rotary movements of the feet (Scott and Starrett 1974).  The eggs hatch six days after oviposition, and the tadpoles ""hang"" head up in the open midwater (Scott and Starrett 1974).   

Common egg predators include dragonfly nymphs, dytiscid beetles and aquatic hemipterans.  Scott and Starrett (1974) have observed adult Purple Gallinules (Porphyrio porphyrio)eating eggs and Green Kingfishers (Chloroceryle americana) eating tadpoles.  Arboreal snakes prey on the adult frogs.

","

","
The current Red List status for this species is Least Concern (LC). The species' population trend is decreasing, but not at a fast enough rate to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.  Possible threats include habitat loss due to agricultural development, illegal crops, logging, and human settlement. More research is needed on population trends, as well as the establishment of additional protected areas (Jungfer et al. 2008).

All five Agalychnis species (A. annae, A. callidryas, A. moreletii, A. saltator, and A. spurrelli) have just received CITES protection, under Appendix II (as of March 21, 2010). Within the past decade the U.S. alone has imported 221,960 Agalychnis frogs, according to the Species Survival Network (SSN). 
","

","
The species was first described by Boulenger (1913). The name given is a patronym for Dr. H. G. F. Spurrell, who collected the type series in Colombia (Duellman 2001).  Roberts (1994a,b) pointed out similarities between this species and A. saltator in breeding behavior and locomotion.

Aplastodiscus leucopygius is a green tree frog that belongs to the A. albosignatus species group (Faivovich et al. 2005), in the Aplastodiscus (Hyla) albosignata complex (Cruz and Peixoto 1985). It is a medium sized frog for the group (35-45 mm SVL). Snout rounded in profile. Tympanum large, diameter about 2/3 to Â¾ of the eye diameter, moderate tympanic fold; single vocal sac. Finger discs large. Dorsum smooth; diffuse glands along the entire flank. Venter granular. A white outlined transverse ridge above the vent composes the cloacal ornamentation. Prominent ovate inner metatarsal tubercle; heel with a fold and well-developed white calcar (Heyer et al. 1990). 

Coloration: Dorsum bright green with small white spots. Belly creamy yellow with bits of white pigment flecks. Tarsal and supra-vent folds white highlighted, with dots spread laterally.  Posterior surface of thigh unpigmented. Iris gold centrally and red or orange peripherally. Bones green (Heyer et al. 1990).  

The tadpole has a mean total length of 52.4 mm at Gosner stage 28. Body elliptical in dorsal view, gray or light brown.  Eyes dorsal.  Snout rounded; nares kidney-like, closer to the eye than to the snout. Oral apparatus ventral. Marginal papillae in a single row; submarginal papillae present. LTRF 2(2)/4(1). Lower jaw V-shaped.  Spiracle sinistral, directed upward, with the end point white. Vent tube dextral. Tail 69% of the total length, being the highest point at the first third, with rounded tip. Moderate tail musculature, with dark transverse bars. Fins reddish; ventral fin lower than the dorsal (Gomes and Peixoto 2002). 
","
Aplastodiscus leucopygius is found in the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil, in the states of Rio de Janeiro, southern Minas Gerais, and eastern SÃ£o Paulo.  It lives near streams or temporary ponds associated with woodlands in the coastal mountains of southeastern Brazil, from 800 m up to 1,600 m a.s.l. 
","
Males of this species call at night from high branches and leaves of trees (above 2 m), near permanent forest streams and rivulets, and less commonly at the forest edge (Heyer et al. 1990; Haddad and Sawaya 2000; Ribeiro et al. 2005). Each chorus can be composed of 4 or 5 calling males (Heyer et al. 1990).  Males give three different vocalization types: advertisement calls, courtship calls, and multi-note (aggressive) calls. The advertisement call is the most common vocalization (Haddad and Sawaya 2000), which sounds like a horn (vocalizations can be heard on Haddad et al. 2005). Calling males use only one pond per reproductive period (Haddad and Sawaya 2000).

A. leucopygius is acoustically active throughout the year, but with a peak in activity during the rainy season, between October and March (Feio 1990; Haddad and Sawaya 2000).  Gravid females and effective reproduction, however, were observed only from December to February in the Serra do Japi (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). An elaborate courtship takes place with a sequence of stereotypical mutual touches between the male and female, and the male eventually guides the female to the concealed subterranean nest (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). The female apparently inspects the nest before accepting the male (Haddad and Sawaya 2000), as is the case for another hylid species, Hypsiboas faber (Martins and Haddad 1988). A. leucopygius lays unpigmented eggs in a floating layer in these subterranean constructed nests, where the larvae also spend their early lives after hatching (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). Nests are made in muddy soil or banks near ponds and rivulets (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). Flooding washes the exotrophic tadpoles out of the nests, after which they occupy temporary ponds or streams (Haddad and Sawaya 2000; reproductive mode 5 of Haddad and Prado 2005).  Tadpoles can inhabit streams varying in depth from 0.5 to 1 m, with the bottom composed of silt and litter. 

A detailed description and discussion of the elaborate courtship behaviour can be found in Haddad and Sawaya (2000), including a description of the three types of vocalization, sexual selection, and the egg clutches, along with a discussion on the evolution of these behaviours and oviposition site. 
","

","
Its range is within protected areas, like the Parque Estadual Nova Baden, at Lambari-MG, RPPN Ovidio Pires, at Bom Jardim-MG, Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca, at Lima Duarte-MG, Serra do Japi, at JundiaÃ­-SP, Parque Municipal do Itapetinga, at Atibaia-SP, EstaÃ§Ã£o BiolÃ³gica de BoracÃ©ia, at SalesÃ³polis-SP, Parque Ãgua Funda, at SÃ£o Paulo, APA Federal da Bacia do Rio ParaÃ­ba do Sul, at ArujÃ¡-SP, Parque Nacional da Serra dos Ã“rgÃ£os, at TeresÃ³polis-RJ, and Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, at Itatiaia-RJ (Cruz and Peixoto, 1985; Feio, 1990; Heyer et al., 1990; Haddad and Sawaya, 2000). A. leucopygius was apparently not affected by factors producing a drastic drop in abundance of several other anuran species in the EstaÃ§Ã£o BiolÃ³gica da BoracÃ©ia in 1979, as reported by Heyer et al. (1988).

The epithet of this species (leucopygius) is related to the white parts of the cloaca and the calcaneous appendix. 

This species was featured in News of the Week May 9, 2022: 
Habitat fragmentation and infectious diseases are two of the biggest global threats to amphibians, but how do these two threats interact? Besides leading to stress and local extirpations in vulnerable wildlife populations, habitat fragmentation can reduce genetic diversity, which in turn may increase susceptibility to disease. Belasen et al. (2022) evaluated relationships between habitat fragmentation, genetic diversity, and disease susceptibility in six frog species endemic to Brazilâ€™s Atlantic Forest, an amphibian diversity hotspot. They specifically tested whether habitat fragmentation reduces diversity in a genetic region related to immune function (MHC IIB), which is associated with amphibian susceptibility to the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). They found that habitat fragmentation was associated with genetic erosion at MHC IIB across species, and individuals that were MHC IIB heterozygotes (â€œhybridsâ€) experienced reduced Bd infection risk. The most severe genetic erosion at MHC IIB occurred in forest specialist frogs including Aplastodiscus leucopygius. Forest specialist frogs also exhibited increased Bd infections (higher prevalence and loads) in fragmented habitats. Overall their results showed that habitat fragmentation impacts MHC IIB diversity and potential disease susceptibility in frogs, with the greatest impacts in sensitive forest specialists.

Bokermannohyla izecksohni is a medium-size hylid frog, reaching a maximum of 51 mm in snout-vent length (Jim and Caramaschi 1979, cited in Caramaschi and Feio 1990). Adults are light brown with a mottled pattern and have yellow coloration on their sides (see photos in Toledo et al. 2008, and AraÃºjo et al. 2009).
","
Four individuals of this species have been collected from three locations in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil.  The type locality is at RubiÃ£o JÃºnior, municipality of Botucatu, in a small remnant patch of mesophytic semideciduous Forest at about 900 m a.s.l. (Jim and Caramaschi 1979).  The type specimen was collected at a temporary pool (Jim and Caramaschi 1979). In 2005 and 2006 three additional individuals of B. izecksohni were found at two different localities in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, about 220 km southeast of the type locality (Toledo et al. 2008). An adult female was collected at the Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar (PESM), NÃºcleo Curucutu, municipality of ItanhaÃ©m (at approximately 700 a.s.l.), and an adult male and an adult female were collected in the municipality of Cotia (at about 900 m a.s.l.). These three individuals were found inside forest, perched on tree branches near tiny streams (Toledo et al. 2008). 
","
Bokermannohyla izecksohni appears to breed in temporary ponds (Stuart et al. 2008). Males of this species were considered voiceless as they do not appear to have vocal sacs (Jim and Caramaschi 1979). However, a distress call has been recorded (Toledo and Haddad 2009).
","

","
The type locality has been destroyed by deforestation due to agriculture and human settlement (Stuart et al. 2008). This species is found only in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, in southeastern Brazil, and has rarely been seen (Stuart et al. 2008). although it may occur more widely in the Atlantic Forest than initially believed and additional surveys are needed (Toledo et al. 2008). The known range does not overlap with any protected areas (Stuart et al. 2008).

Bokermannohyla luctuosa is a large treefrog (SVL 55-70 mm) belonging to the B. circumdata species group (Faivovich et al. 2005). Body robust. The snout is rounded and short, nostrils slightly protuberant directed laterally. Eye large, protruding. The tympanum is large, nearly elliptical, its diameter about 1.2x the eye diameter. Supratympanic fold originating at the posterior corner of the orbit and reaching the shoulder. A single subgular vocal sac, males with vocal slits. Prepollex well developed, with curved spine. Fingers and toes robust. The finger and toe discs are large, nearly rounded, smaller than tympanum. Dorsal and throat texture smooth; belly and undersurfaces of thighs, and anal region granular. Dorsum brown, with darker transverse bars. Flanks pale cream. Posterior surface of the thighs brown with distinct black vertical not bifurcated, interrupted stripes. Belly cream.  This species is sexually dimorphic, with males having vocal slits, a prepollex on each hand and hypertrophied arms (Pombal and Haddad 1993; Napoli 2000).  

The tadpoles have total length of 15 mm at Gosner 25. The oral apparatus is large and directed ventrally, oral disc with a double row of marginal papillae, interrupted dorsally; upper and lower jaw heavy, finely serrated, lower jaw V-shaped; LTRF 2(2)/3(1). The body is ovoid in dorsal view, with a robust tail. Dorsal fin higher than the ventral; dorsal fin origin at the body-tail juncture. The eyes are small and lateral; the nostrils are dorsal. The spiracle is sinistral, positioned on the midline at the posterior part of the body. The color of the dorsum in preservative is brown; throat and belly transparent (Pombal and Haddad 1993).   

","
Bokermannohyla luctuosa lives associated to temporary ponds inside forests, it is also rarely found near forest streams. The species is distributed along the Atlantic Rain Forest in the Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do Mar, in southwestern Rio de Janeiro, eastern Minas Gerais, and eastern SÃƒÂ£o Paulo States, in eastern Brazil, above 800 m (Pombal and Haddad 1993; Napoli 2000). 
","
 

Bokermannohyla luctuosa lives inside woodlands, near temporary ponds and cascading forest streams. It is more commonly encountered on days with low temperature and soft rains (pers. obs). The adults frequently occur on the leaf-litter; Giaretta et al. (1999) report that B. luctuosa contributed 7.9% of the litter frog fauna in the summer in their study site. This species is rarely heard. Males call after midnight on low vegetation (66 cm above ground) in the rainy season from November to March. The advertisement call was described by Pombal and Haddad (1993). The call is given sporadically; call duration 0.60 s. Inactive individuals can also be found on the ground, near large permanent ponds or brooks (Haddad and Sazima 1992; Pombal and Haddad 1993; Napoli 2000; Vasconcelos and Giaretta 2003; Ribeiro et al. 2005; pers. obs.). This species lays eggs with large gelatinous capsules in water-filled depressions (7 cm in diameter) in the ground, near ponds and rivulets. It can also oviposit directly in running waters (Mode 2 and 4 of Haddad and Prado 2005). 
The defense strategy is to emit a distress call and to open the mouth widely (Haddad and Pombal 1993; Haddad et al. 2008).

","
Its range is within protected areas, like the Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, at Itatiaia-RJ, Parque Municipal do Itapetinga, at Atibaia-SP and Serra do Japi, at JundiaÃƒÂ­-SP. It is a common species within its range (Vasconcelos and Giaretta, 1999; Haddad et al., 2008).
","

","
The karyotype is composed of 2n=24 (Pombal and Haddad 1993).  

This genus is dedicated to Werner Carlos Augusto Bokermann (1929Ã¢â‚¬â€œ
1995), as homage to his contribution to the knowledge of Brazilian anurans (Faivovich et al. 2005). The epithet is a Latin adjective (luctuosus=sad), in allusion to the mournful calls heard late in the night (Pombal and Haddad 1993). There is a detailed drawing of the posterior surface of the thigh of this species (a distinctive trait within the group) and a comparison with other members of the species group in Vasconcelos and Giaretta (1999).

Bromeliohyla bromeliacia is a small bromeliad-inhabiting frog with a male snout to vent length is of about 24.1 - 29.5 mm in males and 32.0 - 36.0 mm in females. The flat, short head is as broad or broader than the body. The head length and width are approximately equal.  In the dorsal view, the moderately long snout is acutely rounded and in the lateral view the snout is bluntly rounded. The nostrils are somewhat prominent and found closer to the snout, roughly 3/4th the distance from the eyes to snout tip. The distinct canthus rostralis is slightly angular and the loreal region is concave. The lips are barely flared and thick. The eye is as long as the snout. The tympanum is distinct and located behind the eye at a distance slightly greater than the diameter of the tympanum, which is a third the diameter of the eye.  A thin supratympanic fold begins behind each eye and continues above the tympanum, slightly obscuring it at the upper edge, and ends above the insertion of the arm (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970). 

The arms are short and thick, with a short axillary membrane and a clear row of tubercles on the ventrolateral edge of the forearm. There is also an obvious dermal fold on the wrist. The large palmar tubercle is flat and bifid. The fingers are short and thick and have large discs. The disc of the third finger is approximately the same diameter of the eye while the other discs are approximately the size of the tympanum. Webbing on the hands is indistinct and vestigial. The moderate subarticular tubercles are flattened with the distal subarticular tubercle of the fourth finger being bifid. The hands have large, subconical supernumerary tubercles that are especially dense on the proximal portion of the third finger. In breeding males, the moderate prepollex has horny nuptial excrescences and the base of the thumb has as velvety pad (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970). 

The hind limbs are also short and thick. When the legs are held at right angles to the body, the shanks overlap by one-fifth their length and when the leg is adpressed along the body, the heel reaches the region between the eye and the tip of the snout. The heel is tubercular with a heavy transverse dermal fold. There is also a low, indistinct tarsal fold that extends along the whole tarsus. The flat, low, elliptical inner metatarsal tubercle can be seen from the dorsal view. The small outer metatarsal tubercle is subconical. The long and robust toes have discs that are smaller than the fingers. The tubercles on the feet are large with the subarticular tubercles being subconical and the supernumerary tubercles being round. The toes are approximately one to two-thirds webbed (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970) with a webbing formula of I 2 â€“ 2+ II 1â€“2 1/2 III 1+ â€“ 32  IV 32 â€“ 1+  V (McCranie and CastaÃ±eda 2006). 

The skin is smooth on the dorsal surfaces, ventral surface of the arms, and shanks of the hind limbs. The skin is nearly smooth on the posterior portion of the ventrum. The ventral surfaces of the hind limbs and belly are granular and the throat is slightly granular. There is a singular, median, subgular vocal sac that is moderately distensible. The anal opening is located at the midlevel of the thighs and directed posteroventrally. It has a short anal sheath and large tubercles below the anal opening (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970). 

At hatching (developmental stage 21), tadpoles have body lengths of 2.5 â€“ 2.7 mm and total lengths of 6.7 â€“ 7.1 mm. Body lengths at stage 25 form two distinct size groups that together can range from 3.8 â€“ 9.0 mm. At stage 35, the typical body length is 9.3 mm and a total length of 31.0 mm. Body length at stage 41 is 10.3 â€“ 10.5 mm and total length is about 30.5 mm. Body length at metamorphosis (stage 46) is 11.1 â€“ 11.5 mm. Tadpoles at stage 35 have greatly flattened bodies, almost twice as wide than deep, and are widest at the posterior portion of the body. In the dorsal view, the snout is bluntly rounded and in the lateral view the snout is acutely rounded to the point of almost being spatulated. The nostril is located closer to the tip of the snout than the eyes and directed anteriorly. The small eyes are spaced widely and directed laterally. The ventral mouth is small with a width less than half the body width. The upper lip is bare and there are no lateral folds. The lower lip has two rows of small papillae. The massive beaks have moderately long, pointed serrations. The upper beak is shaped in a broad arch with short lateral processes while the lower beak is present as a narrow arch. There are two upper rows of teeth that are long and nearly extend to the lip. The second row has a medial interruption. The number of lower teeth rows varies from four to five with fewer rows found in the smaller subgroup at stage 25. Smaller individuals may have weakly developed third and fourth rows of teeth. Larger individuals typically have five fully developed rows, but always have at least four. The lower teeth rows have progressively shorter rows, but all are complete. The sinistral spiracle opening is located at the midline approximately two-thirds from the tip of the snout. The dextral anal tube is moderately long. The tail has extensive caudal musculature and a rounded tip. The dorsal fin does not extend onto the body. The tail fins in general are shallow with the deepest portions being towards the posterior (Duellman 1970).

When first described, B. bromeliacia appeared the most similar to Exerodonta sumichrasti but could be distinguished by the former having prominent vomerine teeth, a more distinct tympanum, rounded snout, shorter digit webbing, and a tarsal fold (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970). Bromeliohyla bromeliacia can be distinguished from its close relative Bromeliohyla dendroscarta by B. bromeliacia having hind limbs that are proportionately shorter and thicker, a blunter snout, pigments on the ventral surfaces of the palms and feet, and a dark pigment on the throat (Duellman 1970, McCranie and CastaÃ±eda 2006). From Bromeliohyla melacaena, the focal species can be distinguished by its larger size, small nuptial excrescences on the thumb (vs. large spines), more toe webbing, lack of sexual dimorphism, and opaque ventrum. At some point, specimens of the Jamacian Osteopilus wilderi were also mixed up with B. bromeliacia but could be distinguished by O. wilderi having large thumb spikes (McCranie and CastaÃ±eda 2006). 

Tadpoles of Bromeliohyla can be differentiated from those of closely related genera Duellmanohyla and Ptychohyla by their labial tooth row formula. For the former it is 2/4 or 2/5 while in Duellmanohyla it is 3/3 and the minimum known for Ptychohyla is 3/5 (Faivovich et al. 2005). For other similar species, B. bromeliacia tadpoles can be differentiated from those of E. sumichrasti by the former having a full complement of horny teeth (Schmidt 1933). From Isthmohyla zeteki, the focal species can be distinguished by its well developed tooth rows, depressed body, and long tail. The mouthparts of B. bromeliacia also distinguish it from similar Jamaican bromeliad tadpoles, Oreophyrne brunnea, Osteopilus crucialis, Osteopilus marianae, and Osteopilus wilderi (Duellman 1970).

In life, the dorsal coloration of the head and the body are pale brown to dull yellowish tan depending on the time of day (darker during the day, lighter at night). In the yellowish tan phase, fine flecks of either dark or white coloration are present on the dorsum. They otherwise possess no distinguishable markings (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970). The iris is generally dull bronze with flecks of black, and some irises have an indistinct white strip. The side of the body and posterior portion of the hind limbs are a pale pinkish tan. The ventral side of the thighs is a dull yellow and the venter is white. The throat is pigmented more darkly. Some specimens have a faint white anal strip. In preservative, the dorsum is dull tan to brown and may have dark minute flecks. The flanks, thighs, and dorsal surface of the first two toes are tan. The ventrum is creamy tan with a suffusion of brown on the throat. The ventral surfaces of the hands and feet are brown, especially on the supernumerary tubercles of the feet (Duellman 1970).

In life, the dorsal surface of tadpoles is dull tan to creamy brown while the ventrum is transparent, clearly showing the heart. In preservative, the dorsal surface and caudal musculature becomes a pale creamy tan with black flecks. The fins of the tail are transparent (Duellman 1970). 

The species show sexual dimorphism in size, with females being larger than males (Faviovich et al. 2018). Males possess a disc shaped glandular structure in the abdomen that is not found in females (Schmidt 1933). Males also have small distinct nuptial growths on the thumbs (McCranie and CastaÃ±eda 2006).

","
The range of B. bromeliacia extends through Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and is approximately 50,567 km2. Their elevation range is 350 - 1,790 m asl.  In Mexico, it is found in northwestern Chiapas State on the Atlantic versant. In Guatemala, it occurs in central and eastern regions. It can be found in northeastern Honduras and occurs in the Maya Mountains of Belize. They inhabit wet forests in premontane and montane areas (IUCN 2014).
","
Bromeliohyla bromeliacia is known for its association with bromeliads. They live in the bromeliads and use them for breeding. More specifically, bromeliads are used for ovipositing sites and are where larval stage progresses to completion (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970, Faviovich et al. 2018). 

The species is thought to have a year-round breeding season as varying stages of eggs and tadpoles have been found. Males call softly from bromeliads or the leaves and branches of trees (Duellman 1970). Their call resembles the distinct, isolated strokes of a bell (Schmidt 1933). It consists of 5 â€“ 6 soft notes that each last 0.14 seconds for a total duration of about 5 seconds repeated in 45 â€“ 70 second intervals. Sometimes the last note in the call group is doubled or tripled. The calls have a pulse rate of 195 pulses per second, a dominant frequency of about 3100 Hz, and a fundamental frequency of 135 Hz. Males are difficult to locate based solely on their call because of the directional influence of the bromeliad and the softness of the call (Duellman 1970). 

Eggs, with pigmented animal poles (Faivovich et al. 2005, 2018), are deposited in clusters of about a dozen under the water line at the base of and between leaves in bromeliads. The eggs are contained loosely in pairs in a watery gelatin. After hatching, the tadpoles can be found wriggling at the base of the leaves and have been observed moving over wet surfaces of leaves, out of the water, by forcefully wiggling their tails (Duellman 1970).

","

","
The primary threat faced by B. bromeliacia is deforestation for crops and livestock. They are also affected by the effects of agrochemical use and illegal logging on the periphery of the Sierra Caral protected area. Illegal logging also occurs at Parque Nacional Cusuco. Population declines at higher elevations have been attributed to chytrid fungus, which have occurred in populations in Cusuco. Droughts also pose a problem due to this speciesâ€™ reliance on wet forest conditions, including high humidity (IUCN 2014).

Based on morphology and life history, B. bromeliacia was thought to be closely related to B. dendroscarta (Duellman 1970). This was further supported by Faivovich et al. (2005) in their phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial genes of the family Hylidae that included both species. Based on this evidence, Faivovich et al. (2005) created the genus Bromeliohyla. In 2018, Faivovich et al. re-estimated the Hylidae phylogeny resulting in the addition of B. melacaena (formerly of the genus Isthmohyla) to the genus Bromeliohyla with 87% jackknife support. 

The genus name Bromeliohyla is the combination of the words â€œBromeliaâ€ and â€œHylaâ€, to represent the characteristic behavior of breeding in bromeliads (Faviovich et al. 2005). 

The species epithet, â€œbromeliaciaâ€ is also a reference to the species relationship with bromeliads. More specifically, â€œbromeliadâ€ is the generic name of the group of bromeliads the frog uses, and â€œaceusâ€ is Latin for â€œbelonging toâ€ (Schmidt 1933, Duellman 1970).

Charadrahyla taeniopus has a male snout-vent length that reaches a maximum of 65.9 mm and females have a longer maximum length of 70 mm. The head width is as wide as the flattened body. The snout of C. taeniopus is different between the sexes; the males have a pointed snout while the females have a truncated snout. The tympanum is distinct and is not connected to the eye. The pupil is a horizontal slit (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). The fingers and toes are thin and long with rounded, equally sized discs on the tips. Webbing is present for both toes and fingers. The finger webbing formula is I 2-2 Â¼, II 1Â¼-2, III 2-1 IV and the relative length of fingers is I Charadrahyla genus in life is granular for both the dorsum and ventrum and is thick on the limbs (Campbell et al. 2009). The species is unusual in that the males may lack a vocal sac, although sources are unclear on this (Smith and Taylor 1948). However, species in this genus have nuptial pads, which are composed of dark-colored spinules (Campbell et al. 2009). Some species of the genus, including C. taeniopus, have relatively enlarged testes (Faivovich et al. 2005).
	
For C. taeniopus tadpoles, the total length at Stage 31 is 43.5 mm. The body shape can be described as rounded, with a slight depression of the underside of the snout. The tail meets with the entirety of the posterior of the body and the narrow end of the tail tips upwards. Both the eyes and the nostrils are located dorsally and close to one another. The spiracle is on the sinistral side while the vent is on the dextral side. The mouth of the tadpole is on the ventral side. The oral disc has upper and lower jaw sheaths that are keratinized. The sheaths are darkly colored on the edges where the small serrations lie (Kaplan and Heimes 2015). The mouth has two or three upper rows of teeth and three or four lower rows of teeth with lips bordered by papillae (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014)

Charadrahyla taeniopus and Ecnomiohyla miotympanum are the only frogs that have range overlaps in the municipality of Atzalan. They are differentiated by size, with E. miotympanum being smaller. Charadrahyla taeniopus is differentiated within its genus by a brownish black belly with yellow flecks (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014).

In life, the Charadrahyla genus is known for large patches of brown on the dorsal side (Campbell et al. 2009). Both sexes of the C. taeniopus have yellow dots with background colors of black and brown on the belly. The throat is colored white and silver while the lateral part of the body is a dark brown with yellow spots. Both sexes have clear palpebrum and bronze or grayish tan irises. Sexual dimorphism is demonstrated with female C. taeniopus having reddish brown as the dorsal color with brown markings instead of blackish-brown with yellow spots (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). 

In life, tadpoles have a reddish brown background with gold spots while the tail is a reddish cream color and the fins a gray color. In preservative, the color of a tadpole body is light brown while the tail is a cream color (Kaplan and Heimes 2015).

 The females vary from the males with brown markings on their backs and the background color being a reddish brown. Females also have a truncated snout, while male snouts are pointed (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014).

","
Charadrahyla taeniopus naturally occurs in many parts of Mexico, mostly the Sierra Madre Oriental. The species can be found from Hidalgo del Parral in the northeastern part of the country to the eastern coastal city of Veracruz to the southern Puebla (Santos-Barerra and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2004). The forests that these frogs inhabit occur at a range of 1100 to 2200 m. In these highlands, C. taeniopus needs humid cloud forests (Santos-Barrera and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2004). The humidity also contributes to riparian vegetation, which is necessary for the survival of the species (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). 
","
Charadrahyla taeniopus is a nocturnal and arboreal species that inhabits the cloud forests located in the Hidalgo-Veracruz region of Mexico (Santos-Barerra and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2004). 

Summer rains signal the beginning of the reproductive season (GuzmÃ¡n 2011). During this period of time, the frogs will migrate from the highlands to the streams where they will spawn (Flores HernÃ¡ndez, 2014). Residents of the Atzalan specify the Alseseca River as the primary location where frogs are present, with other seasonal streams and ponds being alternative breeding grounds. Streams with a slow moving current are ideal for reproduction, during which the male utilizes axillary amplexus, gripping around the female under her arms while stimulating her with calluses on his hands to induce egg release (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). 

After the eggs have been fertilized and hatched, the free-swimming larvae can experience rapid larval growth at a temperature range of 20 to 25Â°C. This growth can take three to twenty days, during which the tadpole will feed on algae and detritus (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). 

After metamorphosis into the adult stage this species will adopt an insect-based diet (GuzmÃ¡n 2011). 

","

","
Charadrahyla taeniopus is a declining species due to factors such as habitat destruction and pollution from pesticides (Valdespino et al. 2015). As a whole, amphibians are threatened due to the loss of habitat, which is often converted into farmland for agricultural purposes (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). With less forest to reside in, the species become more exposed to sun and heat with lack of water (Aguilar 2000). Furthermore, pesticides such as DDT are found within the habitat range of the C. taeniopus in large quantities and can remain in the environment for decades. The frog absorbs the pesticide through the skin or by consuming prey that is contaminated by the pesticide, leading to bioaccumulation in the body. These chemicals negatively impact the reproductive cycle and overall health of the species, leading to a decreasing population (Valdespino et al. 2015). 

Along with environmental damage, direct capture by humans is also harming the population numbers. Charadrahyla taeniopus is eaten by locals and captured for trading purposes. This species does not occur in protected areas, as the montane forests are not currently set aside as a national park (Santos-Barerra and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2004).

","
Charadrahyla taeniopus is a representative of the municipality of Atzalan, Veracruz. They are featured on the municipal shield of Atzalan as well as several other monuments, and have been a major food source for residents from the time of the Aztecs (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). 

The capture of these frogs is associated with tradition. The Atzalan people believe that the frogs rain down each year on the same date that the patrons San AndrÃ©s ApÃ³stol and Archangel Michael were venerated, September 29th. It is true that C. taeniopus descend from highlands to reproduce in streams during the first rains of summer (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014). 

The species has a high economic value, worth 30 to 40 pesos per dozen frogs (Quiroz et al. 2012). They can be cooked in soups or made into Calate cakes, worth 100 to 200 pesos in some establishments. While many locals claim that captured frogs are destined for home consumption, some are only interested in selling them (Flores Hernandez 2014). Other reasons for the capture of these frogs include medicine and the pet trade (Santos-Barerra and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2004). 

Although C. taeniopus is in decline, 48% of respondents from Atzalan, Veracruz, do not believe that it is (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014).

The Charadrahyla group is found within the paraphyletic group of Neotropical hylids (Campbell et al. 2009). As of 2005, there were five species within the Charadrahyla taeniopus group: C. altipotens, C. chaneque, C. nephila, C. taeniopus,  and C. trux (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

The species C. taeniopus was originally placed in the genus Hyla, in the Hyla taeniopus group, before being moved to Charadrahyla (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

There is currently no significant evidence that the Charadrahyla group is monophyletic (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

Before diverging into several other genres, the monophyly of Hyla was supported by a 24 or more chromosome karyotype and an extra tendon on the tendo superficialis digiti V (Faivovich et al. 2005).

 Charadra means â€œravineâ€ in Greek and refers to the habitat in which these frogs live (Faivovich et al. 2005). The latter part of the genus name, hyla, is a feminine form of Hylas, which refers to a comrade of Hercules in Greek mythology. Hylas was said to have approached a forest stream where water nymphs pulled him under, enamoured by his beauty (Myers 2006). 

Charadrahyla taeniopus is known as Calates to the locals of Atzalan, Veracruz (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014).

When locals prepare Calates to eat, the frogs cross their arms much like a human when they are introduced to boiling water. No other species of frog is known to do this in Atzalan (Flores HernÃ¡ndez 2014).

Cruziohyla calcarifer is a rare, moderate to large species of the genus Cruziohyla that attains a snout-vent length in males of 56.4 - 80.5 mm, and 57.0 - 88.8 mm in females (Gray 2018). The head is wider than long (Cochran and Goin 1970). The snout is short, broadly triangular from the dorsal view and sloping in the profile (Cochran and Goin 1970, Gray 2018). The slightly projecting nostrils are positioned more laterally than dorsally and closer to the upper lip than the eye. The internarial distance is slightly shorter than the distance from the nostril to the eye. The canthus rostralis is subtle. The loreal region is nearly vertical and slightly concave. The moderate-sized eye has a vertical pupil. The interorbital distance is slightly larger than the width of the upper eyelid and equivalent to the internarial distance (Cochran and Goin 1970). The tympanum almost touches the eye and is about 40 â€“ 60% of the eye diameter (Cochran and Goin 1970, Gray 2018). 

The body is elongated with the post axillary region being noticeably narrower than the widest region of the head. The dorsal skin is finely granular with a glandular fold behind the tympanum extending to the angle of the jaw. The throat and chest are smooth (Cochran and Goin 1970). Breeding males have a single subgular vocal sac that is only slightly distensible (Duellman 2001). The belly and the ventral surfaces of the femur are uniformly granular. There are no lateral skin flaps between the limbs and no traces of skin folds across the chest or vocal sacs. There is a distinct flap above the vent. No inguinal gland is present (Cochran and Goin 1970). 

When the forelimb is extended posteriorly along the body and the hindlimb is adpressed along the body, the elbow and the knee overlap. The ulnar has a well-developed ridge extending from the elbow, along the outer arm to the tip of the fourth finger (Cochran and Goin 1970). The moderately webbed fingers have a webbing formula of I 2 - 2 - II 1+ - 2 III 1 Â½ - 2 - IV (Gray 2018). The fourth finger is considerably longer than the second. The third finger, which has a disc approximately the size of the tympanum, is also longer than the second. There is no pollex (Cochran and Goin 1970). Like other Cruziohyla, breeding males have a spinous nuptial pad at the base of the thumb (Duellman 2001).

The femur is just slightly shorter than the tibia and both are shorter than the foot. When the hindlimb is adpressed along the body, the heel extends beyond the tip of the snout. When held at right angles to the body, the heels overlap. The tarsus has a well-developed ridge extending along the outer margin of the foot to the tip of the fifth toe (Cochran and Goin 1970). There is a calcar on the heel that often terminates in two dermal processes, one projecting inward and the other outward (Gray 2018). The distinct inner metatarsal tubercle is oval. The outer metatarsal tubercle is still distinct but very small and round (Cochran and Goin 1970). 

The moderately webbed toes have a webbing formula of I 1 - 1+ II 1 - 2 III 1+ - 3 IV 3 - 2 - V (Gray 2018). The first toe is not opposable. It is shorter than the second, and the third and fifth toes are approximately equal in length. The disc of the fourth toe is about the same size as the tympanum (Cochran and Goin 1970).

For a description of the tadpole, which has distinctive morphology, mouthparts and markings that set it apart, please see Gray et al. 2021.


Cruziohyla calcarifer is distinguished from both other species in the genus, C. sylviae and C. craspedopus, by a combination of the following characters: (1) prominent dark brown ventral thigh markings present either side of the vent in both sexes; (2) small tympanum, diameter 40 â€“ 60% that of the eye; (3) fingers and toes moderately webbed, approximately two-thirds (4) in life, upper surfaces uniform green, often having small white or pale blue spots; (5) in life, yellow-colored spot on the posterior rim of the eye when open; (6) short black bars to lateral surfaces of the flanks; (7) color of undersides, hands, feet, concealed surfaces of thighs and flanks, orange; (8) short sloping snout; (9) calcar on heel, often terminating in two dermal processes with one projecting inward and one projecting outward (Gray 2018).

More specifically, the dark ventral markings found on the thigh region of C. calcarifer are not found on any other Cruziohyla species. The species lacks the lichenose marking found on the dorsal surfaces of both other Cruziohyla. Cruziohyla calcarifer also has a noticeably small tympanum, ranging between 40 â€“ 60% the diameter of the eye compared with a tympanum size of 70 â€“ 100% the diameter of the eye in C. sylviae. Juvenile C. sylviae and C. craspedopus lack the bright yellow markings above the mouth seen in C. calcarifer. Further distinctions between C. calcarifer and C. sylviae include C. calcarifer having more moderate webbing than C. sylviae, extending only to the antepenultimate phalanx on the 4th toe (Cochran and Goin 1970).

In life, C. calcarifer has a uniform green dorsal skin surface with a scattering of very fine white or pale blue spots to the dorsal surfaces, recognized by Myers and Duellman (1982) and reported on by IbÃ¡Ã±ez et al. (1999). The palpebral membrane not reticulated (Cochran and Goin 1970). The iris is a pale gray medially, and yellow on the periphery (Myers and Duellman 1982). The species has bright yellow flanks and thighs, with short, black, vertical finger-like bars extending approximately halfway down the flanks (Cochran and Goin 1970). The arms, excluding the dorsal surfaces of the forearms are deep orange, as are the hands and feet with the exception of the fourth finger and fifth toe. Those surfaces that are not orange have dorsal coloring and patterning (Myers and Duellman 1982). The nuptial pads are brown (Duellman 2001). The throat is yellow and the other ventral surfaces are yellow to orange (Myers and Duellman 1982). This species has dark ventral markings, which are a highly unusual feature to be found on any hylid frog: Developing into distinctive triangular patterning on the thighs this prominent characteristic develops soon after metamorphosis and is distinct before juveniles attain their adult coloration.

When preserved, the dorsum becomes dark, deep blue and is sharply separated from the lighter ventral surface. The finger-like vertical bars on the flanks retain their black coloration. At the hip, the dorsal coloration extends along the dorsal margin of the thighs to the knees. The dorsal surface of the shanks, the metatarsal region, and the dorsal surface of the fifth toe also share the same dorsal coloration. Similar to the flanks, the thighs have finger-like projections from the dorsal margin towards the inner margin of the shank. The dorsal surfaces of the feet also have similar markings. The ventral surfaces of the wrist and fourth finger have brown markings. There are brown spots to the sides and posterior of the vent, and on the ventral surface of the metatarsal region, the base of the fourth toe, and the entire ventral surface of the fifth toe (Cochran and Goin 1970). 

Newly metamorphosed juvenile C. calcarifer show bright yellow markings above the mouth and on their lower eyelid (Cochran and Goin 1970, Gray 2018).

Variation is noted in the extent of the outward facing calcar found on the heel: in all specimens from Costa Rica and Panama this feature is large, extensive, and marked with dark pigmentation; in some specimens from Colombia and Ecuador the outward-facing calcar on the heel is highly reduced and more rounded (Gray 2018). Breeding males have the secondary sexual characters of nuptial pads and vocal sacs (Duellman 2001).

","
Highly restricted populations of C. calcarifer occur in northwest Ecuador, western Colombia, Panama, southeastern Costa Rica: Specifically, highly restricted populations occur from Esmeraldas Province in northwest Ecuador (Boulenger 1902, Cisneros-Heredia 2005, Coloma et al. 2008), through western Colombia at several reported localities (Boulenger 1913, Cochran and Goin 1970, Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996). In Colombia, the species has been recorded in Municipal Mecana in the ChocÃ³ and Valle de Cauca (Vargas and BolaÃ±os 1999, Lynch and SuÃ¡rez 2004, Castro-Herrera and Vargas-Salinas 2008). The species is also found from Panama (Myers and Duellman 1982, Crawford et al. 2010), to the most southerly part of Costa Rica, where it was found in the Fila Carbon area of Comadre, LimÃ³n Province (Faivovich et al. 2010).
","
Cruziohyla calcarifer is a highly nocturnal species, which lives and reproduces in primary forest. Males have been heard calling high up in trees, however their vocalizations are soft, having little carrying power (Myers and Duellman 1982). The advertisement calls consist of single low-pitched notes of 135 â€“ 212 milliseconds duration repeated at regular intervals (Gray 2018). 

C. calcarifer has reproductive traits, which differ from both other members of the genus: C. calcarifer deposit their egg clutches on the lower central section of leaves overhanging small ponds or open water bodies, whereas C. craspedopus and C. sylviae lay egg clutches above flooded hollows or water cavities between buttresses of fallen trees. The courtship and breeding behaviour witnessed for C. calcarifer appears most similar to that of Agalychnis spurrelli, where adults congregate â€˜en masseâ€™ and lay their eggs on leaves in and around open ponds and pools by the side of the road (Gray et al. 2021). The tadpole also differs from that of others in the genus, having distinctive morphology, mouthparts and markings that set it apart (Gray et al. 2021).

","

","
Although rare, with less than 50 specimens documented in over 100 years, the conservation status of C. calcarifer, which is currently â€œLeast Concernâ€ is under assessment by the IUCN. Cruziohyla calcarifer is particularly rare and populations are highly restricted in all countries in which it is known to occur: In Ecuador the species is recorded very infrequently and where it occurs is under considerable human pressure (Stuart et al. 2008, Coloma et al. 2008), In Colombia, the species is recorded only at very few localities, mainly in the ChocÃ³ and Valle de Cauca (Castro-Herrera and Vargas-Salinas 2008) and information on the level of potential threats faced by the species there is limited, in Panama, only thirteen specimens are known (Myers and Duellman 1982, Crawford et al. 2010), the last 2 being found over 15 years ago, in Costa Rica only five specimens are currently known, the last being found in 1977. 
","

","
Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences shows that C. calcarifer is highly divergent from both other members of the genus: DNA sequences of the 16S rRNA gene confirm C. calcarifer having minimum 6.2% genetic divergence from both C. sylviae and C. craspedopus (Gray 2018). 

The specific epithet â€œcalcariferâ€ refers to the triangular dermal flap on the heel which points outward when the frog is at rest (from the Latin â€œcalcarâ€, meaning â€œspurâ€, and â€œferoâ€, meaning â€œto carryâ€) (Duellman 1970).

Between the species description in 1902 and 1970 only nine specimens were collected. The species description was made from a single specimen (Gray 2018).

Until 2018 this species was confused with C. sylviae, which is much more commonly found and occurs from Panama to Honduras (Gray 2018).

The dark ventral thigh markings found on this species are a highly unusual feature to be found on any hylid frog and the presence and distinctiveness of these suggest a special function for this feature, although this is yet to be determined (Gray 2018). 

The original tadpole description for C. calcarifer was of a specimen from northern Costa Rica and has since been found to represent that of C. sylviae, a species previously confused with C. calcarifer and which was only discovered and described in 2018 (Gray 2018). The tadpole of the true C. calcarifer was described in 2021 from a specimen originating from the type locality in Ecuador (Gray et al. 2021).

Males 18-21 mm, 
females 23 mm. The dorsum is 
orange-brown with a large dark 
brown spot between the eyes and 
another on the fore part of the back. 
The snout is truncated. There is a 
white horizontal bar below the eye. 
The iris is orange brown. During the 
day individuals may be whitish.
","
This species has 
been recorded near some large ponds 
beside the streams AcarÃ¡ and Ipiranga.
","
The species is arboreal and nocturnal. Reproductive activities are observed throughout the six months of rainy season. Oviposition is closely associated with rainfall. Males were found calling from shrubs in and near ponds in March. Egg clutches are deposited on the upper surfaces of leaves of shrubs, and tadpoles fall into the water after hatching.

Notes on oviposition: Calling males hold females in an axillary embrace. Females then goes to leaves overhanging the water after amplexus. After arriving at the tip of the leaf, male-carrying females hold the edge of the leaf with their hindlegs, and remain still in an upward position for 18-125 seconds before egg deposition. Oviposition is characterized by periods of rest and activity, lasting around 14.2 s and 7 s, respectively. Activities begin with the females lifting their heads and taking on a position with a slightly arched back. The males then inseminate the eggs. Activities last approximately seven seconds and repeat every fourteen seconds. After insemination, the male rests his knee against the female body until the next bout begins. Zero to 14 eggs are laid in each bout. After each egg-laying bout, females use their hind legs to spread out the eggs into a single layer. The female oviposition maneuver continues up to about 9 bouts after the last egg has been laid; egg spreading continues up to forty minutes after the male's departure. This is perhaps to show the lateral bright markings and egg-shaped spots on the outer flanks of the female's thigh, and make the eggs appear to be lateral surfaces of the female body. All oviposition sites are above water, but the majority occur on the upper side of green leaves. Eggs are bright yellow. Eggs were usually eaten by carabid beetles and conocephalid grasshoppers. Five to seven days after oviposition, the tadpoles drop into the water and approximately 49% of the deposited eggs generally survived. Under artificially covered clutches, 88% survived. (HÃ¶dl 1991).

The size of the Dendropsophus ebraccatus varies between regional populations. The average snout-vent length of an adult male ranges from 23.63 - 26.75 mm (Ohmer et. al 2009), while females are slightly larger, reaching 36.5 mm (Duellman 1970). The species has a short, truncated snout, and its head is flat and wider than its body (Duellman 1970). The eyes are large compared to the head, and the pupil is horizontal (Leenders 2016). Adults have vomerine teeth (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013). There is a thin dermal fold that extends from the back edge of the eye to near the arm. This fold covers the upper edge of the tympanum, which is roughly one-fourth the size of the eye (Savage 2002) and has a distinct ridge on the front edge (Duellman 1970). Adult males have paired vocal slits and a single extensible vocal sac. The skin on the dorsum is smooth, while the skin on the ventrum is granular (Savage 2002).

The limbs are relatively short. The front limbs have an extensive axillary membrane and are slightly more robust than the hind limbs. The tips of all the digits have discs, with the discs being larger on the hands than the feet (Duellman 1970). The disc on the third digit of the front limb is larger than the tympanum (Savage 2002). The front foot has webbing covering roughly half the length of the digits. The webbing between the first and second digit is vestigial, and extends from the middle of the penultimate phalanx on the second digit to the base of the penultimate phalanges on the third and fourth digits. The webbing on the hind foot is more extensive, covering roughly three-quarters of the length of the digits. The webbing starts at the base of the toe disc on the first digit, continues to the distal end of the penultimate phalanx on the second digit, then connects to the base of the penultimate phalanx on the third digit. The webbing then connects from the base of the toe disc on the third digit to the distal end of the antepenultimate digit on the fourth digit, and terminates at the toe disc on the fifth digit. The hind foot also has a thin tarsal fold that runs the full length of the tarsus (Duellman 1970).

Hatchling tadpoles can range from 6.72 to 7.47 mm long in total length (Gonzalez et al. 2011). Tadpoles at developmental stage 36 average 29 mm in total length (Savage 2002). The tadpoles have a blunt snout, small dorsolateral nostrils, and laterally directed eyes (Duellman 1970). The body is violin-shaped (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013) or ovoid with a sinistral spiracle. The small mouth is terminal (Duellman 1970) and has finely serrated upper and lower beaks, though no denticles (Savage 2002). The tail is long with a thin flagellum at the end (Savage 2002) and high fins (Duellman 1970). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus is one of at least 97 species in the genus Dendropsophus and is placed within the group of leaf-gluing frogs that includes at least eight other species. Dendropsophus ebraccatus is the only species of the nine that is trans-Andean; the other eight species are cis-Andean.  Dendropsophus ebraccatus can be differentiated from similar species by the bands that are usually on the upper side of its dorsum. Dendropsophus ebraccatus has abnormal bands that are disrupted by brown smudges, while its close relatives D. manonergra and D. triangulum have a more consistent pattern. Dendropsophus manonergra does not have disruptions within its bands while D. triangulum has a consistent disruption, if present. Dendropsophus manonergra, D. roassalleni,  and D. sarayacuensis have triangle shaped blotches between both of their eyes (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013). Dendropsophus ebraccatus is also commonly confused with D. phlebodes and D. microcephala. Both of the latter species lack the hourglass pattern on the dorsum, allowing for easy differentiation when the D. ebraccatus individual has this distinctive pattern. When the hourglass pattern is absent on an individual, D. ebraccatus can be distinguished from both D. microcephala and D. phlebodes by its dark eye mask and pale lip stripe (Leenders 2016), as well as its finger webbing, which is more extensive than the other two species (Savage 2002). Dendropsophus phlebodes also has a grey tint to its dorsum coloration, whereas D. ebraccatus is brightly colored (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Dendropsophus ebraccatus can be further differentiated from D. microcephala and D. phlebodes by its long primary calling notes. These three species have different pulse rates in their callings, with D. ebraccatus having the slowest pulse rate (Savage 2002). In addition, D. microcephala callings are much higher in frequency than D. ebraccatus (Wilczynski et al. 1993). 

In life, D. ebraccatus usually has a yellow dorsum with golden-brown blotches forming the shape of an hourglass, giving it the common name â€œhourglass treefrog.â€ The dark blotches are sometimes bordered by lighter colors, such as bright yellow, cream, or white (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). While the hourglass pattern is most common, there are 10 different pattern variants that range in the extent of the dark blotches, from completely tan-yellow with no blotches to the actual hourglass-shaped pigmentation (Ohmer et al. 2009). Dendropsophus ebraccatus also has a dark brown eye mask extending as a stripe past the eye and covering the tympanum. Beneath this dark eye mask they often have a pale lip stripe that expands below the eye to form a light spot (Leenders 2016). Dendropsophus ebraccatus generally have banded limbs, with the same coloring as their dorsum (Leenders 2001). The thighs are uniformly bright yellow or orange on both the dorsal and ventral sides (Leenders 2016). The fingers generally have no color (Cope 1874). The iris varies in color from a pale yellow or tan to a dark brownish-red (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). 

In life, tadpoles have a brown to black dorsum with brightly colored blotches, and a pale ventrum (Savage 2002). The blotches are red, gold, white, or any combination of the three colors (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). The tail is primarily gold with black barring, and the fins are generally red with black barring (Savage 2002). There is a pigmented spot on the tail that varies in color and size depending on the predators in their environment (Touchon and Warkentin 2008 Oikos).  The iris is red and bronze (Savage 2002). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus lives in a range of elevations. One study shows that D. ebraccatusâ€™ body size throughout all stages of growth correlates with the elevation a population is living at, with populations living at higher elevations (greater than 300 m) in Pacific versant populations being larger than those at lower elevations. The same study also showed that populations on the Pacific side of the Cordillera de Talamanca mountain range have larger body sizes. In addition, there are roughly ten different color variations (Ohmer et al. 2009). The patterning on the dorsum ranges from a clear hourglass shape with or without additional spots surrounding it to a solid yellow dorsum with no blotches, and spans all coloring in between (Savage 2002). Dendropsophus ebraccatus females are slightly larger than males, and males have an easily discernible vocal patch (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).

","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus lives in Central America from southern Mexico to Ecuador (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010) at elevational ranges of 0 - 1600 m. Populations are isolated in some areas by the mountain range, Cordillera de Talamanca (Ohmer et al. 2009), and are not as prevalent in Ecuador (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010). Dendropsophus ebraccatus is most commonly found in humid lowland forests (Leenders 2016), but they have also been found in habitat edges, orchards, pastures, and secondary vegetation indicating a tolerance of human disturbances. Dendropsophus ebraccatus is typically found on vegetation that hangs above both permanent and temporary pools of water (Matias and Escalante 2015). 
","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus is a nocturnal, arboreal frog that is abundant throughout its range (Gonzalez et al 2011). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus has been found to cohabitate with closely related frogs that utilize the same spatial and food resources. The species preys on terrestrial invertebrates and has been found to have little to no competition with its close relative D. phlebodes, the San Carlos treefrog. Due to D. ebraccatusâ€™ larger size, it eats larger prey animals while D. phlebodes eats smaller invertebrates. Regardless of the predation distribution, empty frog stomachs in the field provide evidence that the majority of their time is allocated to calling. These males have overlapping breeding grounds that are utilized to find mates. It is believed that these frogs can coexist due to the heterogeneity in the environment; they have been found to use various types of foliage with differing heights to call for females, which allows for perch height segregation (JimÃ©nez and Bolainos 2012).

Dendropsophus ebraccatus mate from May to November, when its surrounding environment is at its wettest (Ohmer et al. 2009). Hoping to attract a female, males call from 15 cm to 2 m (Miyamoto and Cane 1980 Copiea) above ponds created during the rainy season (Ohmer et al. 2009). Males produce multiple types of calls including defensive and aggressive calls, which they use to compete with males of their own species and neighboring heterospecifics, as well as advertisement calls (Savage 2002). The different types of calls have different pitches. High pitch calls are used for intrasexual competition. However, females show preference for low pitches over high pitches (Reichert 2011). 

Advertisement calls are composed of buzz-like introductory notes that may be followed a click-like secondary notes or aggressive calls depending on if they are calling alone or in response to other males. Lone males often only call with the first note. The duration of advertisement calls is between 96 â€“ 240 ms, with a pulse rate of 85 - 110 pulses per second and with 54 â€“ 92% of the call spent rising in amplitued. The dominate frequency is around 3 kHz (Wells and Schwartz 1984). Females prefer a swifter call rate that includes multiple notes, rather than a single note (Vitt and Caldwell 2009).

Aggressive calls are more variable but are generally longer (120 â€“ 664 ms) than adveritsement calls, have a higher pulse repetition rate (157 â€“ 461 pulses per second) and may include secondary click notes. The proportion of call time spent rising in amplitued also has a greater variation of 11 â€“ 93%.  The dominate frequency, like the advertisement call, is around 3 kHz (Wells and Schwartz 1984). 

Males increase the aggressiveness in their calls when other males are nearby (Reichert 2011). When males are further from each other they have shorter introductory notes which increase in length as distance between males decreases.  Additionally, pulse rate is positively correlated to an aggressive response from other males and rising time appears to be an important feature when pulse rates were high (Wells and Schwartz 1984). 

Males call throughout the night while staying in a vegetative pond area (Touchon and Worley 2015). Non-calling, sneaker, males are also present and position themselves in the space between the calling males and the females. From this position, the silent males remain still so when an allured female makes her way to the calling male he can attempt to mate with her (Miyamoto and Cane 1980 Biotropica).

Advertising males call faster as females approach them until the female rotates her body toward the male, at which point he stops calling (Savage 2002). Males position themselves on the females via axillary amplexus (Miyamoto and Cane 1980 Copiea). After external fertilization, a female can lay around 180 to 300 eggs in one night (Touchon and Worley 2015). Females are capable of ovipositing on both land and water. The terrestrial eggs are commonly placed above the water on a plant to allow the tadpoles to fall into the water after hatching, while aquatic eggs are place beneath the surface on vegetation. Their decision of placement depends on environmental cues rather than genetics. For example, less shaded regions would influence the female to oviposit aquatically rather than terrestrially to decrease chances of desiccation (Touchon and Warkentin 2008 PNAS). If aquatic predators are present, D. ebraccatus will lay eggs in overlying vegetation and risk desiccation. Eggs oviposited in the water are able to hatch after forty hours ; the developmental rate for terrestrial eggs is much slower  (Touchon and Worley 2015). 

In order for the species to oviposit on both land and water, the eggs must be able to withstand the either environment. While most amphibians begin releasing a hatching enzyme right before they hatch,D. ebraccatus gradually releases the enzyme as the embryo develops and the vitelline membrane slowly degrades. This process accelerates hatching, enables the tadpole to avoid threats such as predation or desiccation, and allows offspring to take the best course of action for survival (Cohen et al. 2018). 

Tadpoles graze the shallow waters for algae (Gonzalez et al. 2011), generally hiding in clumps of vegetation (Leenders 2001). One study showed how the presence of dragonflies causes tadpoles to develop a redder pigment on their tail and a larger tail in comparison to the presence of fish, which causes tadpoles to grow smaller tails. These different responses in tail morphology may be evolutionary adaptations to avoid predators. The red spot and large tails on tadpoles subjected to dragonflies may be deterring dragonflies from eating them while the small tails may help propel tadpoles away from fish (Touchon and Warkentin 2008 Oikos). The tadpoles metamorphose into frogs four to six weeks after hatching (Savage 2002).

Adult variation in dorsal patterning is explained by both regional genetic drift and environmental pressures. The purpose for the bright coloration in D. ebraccatus is unknown; it is possible the color and patterns are a form of aposematism or a form of crypsis. The toxicity of the poison glands are unknown, and due to the broad range of endemicity, it is difficult to determine the selection pressures acting on the coloration of the species. There is some indication that the variation and frequency in coloration is not due to sexual selection, but rather natural selection (Ohmer et al. 2009).
 
Dendropsophus ebraccatus is highly susceptible to predation and parasitism (Touchon and Warkertin 2008 PNAS). In one study, individuals were found to host the nematode parasite Cosmocerca parva. However, there is no indication that this parasite has a major effect on the species population (Bursey and Brooks 2010). In addition to parasites, large aquatic invertebrates-such as dragonfly larvae and water bugs- and fish have been seen to regularly prey on D. ebraccatus eggs (Touchon and Warketin 2008 PNAS). 

When aquatic predators are abundant, D. ebraccatus may lay eggs terrestrially to increase the chances of egg survival (Cohen et al. 2018). Terrestrially lain eggs are subject to predation by spiders, wasps, and ants (Touchon and Warketin 2008 PNAS).

","

","
Dendropsophus ebraccatusâ€™ population trend is stable, and is listed as â€œLeast Concernâ€ on the IUCN Red List. The hourglass treefrog is an adaptable species that has thus far not been impacted by human disturbances (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010). The ability of females to oviposit on both land and water allows reproduction to be flexible. However, changes in the amount of rainfall due to climate change could make terrestrial egg deposits more susceptible to desiccation (Touchon and Worley 2015). While the environment could lead to egg desiccation, deforestation and contamination from pesticides associated with farming could affect adults because the species is primarily forest dwellers. However, the flexibility of D. ebraccatus' life history allows some populations to live in unforested areas (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010), including parks and agricultural lands (Leenders 2016). However, it was found that the mean size and age was decreased in areas of high human disturbance. It is possible that the difference in size is due to lowered life expectancy; no limb asymmetry was found. (Matias and Escalante 2015).

The presence of chytridiomycosis in D. ebraccatus is low. When scientists examined if the root of the low frequency could be due to differences in the environment or differences in their microbiota, it was found that the microbiota of Panamanian treefrogs is in fact different from other frogs, but no conclusive evidence linked the differing microflora to the low rates of chytridiomycosis (Belden et al. 2015).

","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus is used for research purposes with special interest surrounding its rapid hatch rate and its ability to oviposit both terrestrially and aquatically, which is found only in a few species. In addition to the research interest, these animals are kept as pets (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010) and used as attractions for ecotourism sites in Central America (Spangler 2015).

Bransford, Assistant Surgeon United States Navy, while attached to the Nicaraguan Surveying Expedition in 1873â€. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 26: 64â€“72. 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus is a frog in the family Hylidae. In 2005, D. ebraccatus was moved from the genus Hyla to the genus Dendropsophus in accordance with its molecular evidence. The genus Dendropsophus was resurrected to encompass many species that were moved from Hyla due to shared characteristics of mitochondrial evidence and pectoral glands in males and females (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus is part of the D. leucophyllatus species group. Based on Maximum Parsimony analysis of 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and tRNA Valine genes, D. ebraccatus is sister to the clade composed of D. bifurcus, D. leucophyllatus, D. manoegra, D. saryacuensis, and D. triangulum (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013). This analysis supports an earlier Baysian and Maximum Likelihood analysis of 808 base pairs of 12S and 16S rRNA, which had lower confidence scores (Fouquet et al. 2011). Both studies indicate that the clade including D. ebraccatus is sister to a clade including D. salli and D. elegans but disagree on the placement of D. miyatai in relation to D. ebraccatus (Fouquet et al. 2011, Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013).

The species epithet, ebraccatus is latin for â€œwithout trousersâ€ (Smithsonian Tropical Institute: Amphibians of Panama, accessed 2018); the name is thought to reference the lack of patterning on the speciesâ€™ thighs (Leenders 2001).  

Dendropsophus ebraccatus was first named Hyla ebraccata in 1874 (Cope 1874). In 1954, its name was changed to Hyla weyerae. In 2005, the species was changed from the genus Hyla to the genus Dendropsophus, which gave rise to the scientific name used today, Dendropsophus ebraccatus (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

Dendropsophus ebraccata has 30 diploid chromosomes, or a karyotype of 2n = 30 (Savage 2002).

A small to medium-sized tree frog with a average snout-vent length of 29.7 mm in males and 37.9 mm in females. It has an axillary membrane to elbow; webbing at the base of fingers; webbed feet; single palmar tubercle; and moderate pectoral patches (Caminer et al 2017).

Its coloration in life varies from brown to dark brown with bright yellow or white dorsolateral bands extending to the tip of the snout; a leaf-shaped mark on the sacrum is also bright yellow or white; and two bright yellow or white bands cover its shank which also may be fused and cover the leg completely. Some individuals may have a reticulated color pattern. The ventrum and webbing may be red, orange or pink. The eyes are large, round and prominent with dull or coppery bronze irises (Caminer et al 2017).
","
Caminer et al (2017) confirms this species is known from northern Brazilian Amazonia, Suriname, Guyana and French Guiana ranging in elevation from sea level to 400 m at Grande Montagne Tortue, Guyana.


","
Caminer et al (2017) reports they were found in permanent or semi-permanent ponds along roads or in pristine moist rain forest, large coastal swamps, and at the edges of forest savannas. They have been found perching above water from a few centimeters to several meters above in the tree canopy.

Caminer et al (2017) analyzed the Dendropsophus leucophyllatus species complex, describing two new species in the process:  Dendropsophus arndti sp. nov., D. leucophyllatus, D. triangulum, D. reticulatus, D. vraemi sp. nov.. They delimited this species to the northeastern region of South America based on their molecular analysis.

This species was featured in the News of the Week April 25, 2022: 
Frogs and toads have large, prominent eyes and many visually-guided behaviors, making them an exciting group in which to study the evolution of vision. Some frogs, such as the Clown Tree Frog, Dendropsophus leucophyllatus, have spectral filters in the lenses of their eyes that block short wavelengths of light (e.g., UV), with important implications for how they see in low light and the resolution of their vision. Thomas et al. (2022) measured the spectral transmission of light through the ocular lenses of 85 species of frogs and salamanders and tested whether shortwave filtering was associated with ecology. They found that day-active frogs more commonly evolve lenses that filter out shortwave light, which should protect the retinas of diurnal species from damage and improve visual acuity in bright environments. Night-active species usually had more transparent lenses, likely to maximize sensitivity in dim light. However, despite being mostly nocturnal, scansorial species that typically climb up into plants show selection for stronger shortwave filtering in their lenses than species that tend to be found on the ground or in water. Climbing frogs may sacrifice sensitivity for resolution to navigate their complex arboreal environments. (Written by Katie Thomas)

Dendropsophus microcephalus is a small frog. Adult males have a snout vent length of up to 27 mm  
(McCranie and Wilson 2002). Honduran females measure up to 29 mm  
(McCranie and Wilson 2002), while Mexican and Costa Rican females may reach 30.6 mm  
(Duellman 2001).   
 
The head is flat and the snout is round and short.  Eyes have horizontally elliptical pupils. Nostrils are laterally directed and the area between nostrils is somewhat concave.  No vertical rostral keel is present.  The tympanum is located slightly below the eye at a distance of about its own length.  The supratympanic fold is weak. The tongue is ovoid and free for about one-third of its length posteriorly.  Maxillary teeth are conical.  Vomerine teeth are present, with tooth patches on raised ridges between ovoid to elliptical choanae and separated by slightly less than their own length. The dorsal skin is generally smooth, while the ventral surfaces range from weakly granular on the throat to coarsely areolate on the belly. This species has a well-developed axillary membrane. The upper arm is slimmer than the forearm. A weak transverse dermal fold is present on the upper surface of the wrists but no vertical dermal fold is present on the elbow. A weakly defined inner tarsal fold is present, which spans the length of the tarsus, but no dermal ridge is present along the posterior ventrolateral edge of the tarsus.  
(McCranie and Wilson 2002).  
 
 
Fingers are 1/3 webbed and the toes 3/4 webbed 
 (Duellman 2001).  Lateral keels are present on unwebbed sections of the fingers.  Fingers and toes have discs expanded to a nearly ovoid shape with rounded disc covers.  The discs on the toes are slightly smaller than the discs on the fingers. Subarticular tubercles are present on the fingers and are globular to conical and round.  Supernumerary tubercles are not present on the fingers. The palmar tubercle is low, ovoid, and sometimes bifid to occasionally indistinct.  The accessory palmar tubercles are round and slightly raised. The prepollex is round, enlarged and does not bear nuptial excrescences. On the toes, the subarticular tubercles are spherical in shape.  Supernumerary tubercles are not present on the toes.  The inner metatarsal tubercle is oval and raised, and the outer metatarsal tubercle is small, rounded and elevated.  There is no vertical dermal fold on the heel.  No nuptial pads are present    
(McCranie and Wilson 2002).    
 
This species can undergo metachrosis, or color change.  During the night, the dorsum is a light yellow color with various brown or tan markings. During the day, the dorsum is a tan-yellow color, or light brown with darker brown or red markings 
 (Duellman 2001). The venter is white, and breeding males have a yellow vocal sac  
(Duellman 2001). This frog has uniformly yellow thighs with a brown line, often bordered with a narrow white line extending from the nostril to the vent  
(Leenders 2001).  The dorsal pattern on this species is variable; many individuals have an ""X"" shape on their backs, or two longitudinal bars connected with a crossbar. Others have irregularly placed dark brown dashes. In specimens from Mexico and Guatemala, the lateral brown stripe only extends to the sacral region, but in Costa Rica, many specimens have a stripe that extends to the groin  
(Duellman 2001). The iris is bronze. 
(McCranie and Wilson 2002).  
 
Dendropsophus microcephalus tadpoles collected east of Esparta, Costa Rica typically had a total length of 28 mm and a body length of 9.2 mm  
(Duellman 2001).  Eyes are dorsolateral and the snout is pointed.  The body is wider than it is deep.  The mouth has finely serrated beaks and no teeth.  The dorsal fin reaches onto the body. The spiracle is sinistral. Tadpoles have a yellow dorsum and a white venter, and the posterior half of the tail is orange. A brown stripe runs from the larval snout through the eye  
(Campbell 1998).  
","
Dendropsophus microcephalus ranges from the Pacific lowlands in southeastern Costa Rica eastward to Colombia (subspecies Dendropsophus microcephalus microcephalus); from northern South America to the Amazon basin (subspecies D. m. misera), and from Mexico down to northwestern Costa Rica (subspecies D. m. underwoodi)  
(Duellman 2001; BolaÃ±os et al. 2008; BolÃ­var-G et al. 2009). It is also found in Trinidad and Tobago (Duellman 2001; BolaÃ±os et al. 2008). In Honduras, this frog is found almost all areas, including the Bay Islands, except for the extreme south and southwest  
(McCranie and Wilson 2002).
 
The subspecies D. m. microcephalus occurs at elevations below 560 m, in Colombia (Duellman 2001). The subspecies D. m. underwoodi is not found at elevations higher than 350 m in Mexico and Guatemala, but is found at higher elevations in more southern regions.  For instance, it has been collected at 780 m in Silencio, Costa Rica; at 830m in Montana de Guaimaca, Honduras; at 960 m in Finca Tepeyac, Nicaragua, and at 1200 m in Finca Renecia, Nicaragua  
(Duellman 2001). 
 
 
Dendropsophus microcephalus is mainly found in pastures or disturbed forests  
(Leenders 2002). It is not seen within primary rainforests but instead around their borders in open spaces, roadside trenches, and short-lived ponds  
(Savage 2002). In the Bay Islands of Honduras, this species lives around hardwood forests, swamps and marshes  
(McCranie et al. 2005).   
","
 During the mating season, the male frogs gather in large groups around the breeding areas and call from grasses or sedges at the edge of water, or while perched on emergent vegetation.  Preferred breeding areas are temporary ponds, shallow ditches, or marshes. The eggs of this species are laid on or near the surface of the water, where they are usually attached to emergent vegetation  
(Duellman 2001).

The distinct â€œcreek-eek-eek-eekâ€ insect-like calls are characterized by a primary unpaired note with a series of short, secondary paired notes  
(Duellman 2001).  The repetition rate of the mating call is 197 to 384 notes per minute.  The primary note duration is 0.05 to 0.15 s, and the secondary note has duration of 0.06 to 0.11 s. 

Males usually sing in large choruses, with thousands of individuals.  However, during the dry season, only a few males may gather and call from a drying swamp  
(Campbell 1998). Instead of calling independently, males will respond to conspecific males and other male species within a group. In an experiment conducted by Schwartz and Wells  
(1985), males synchronized to individual calls and also responded to distant choruses.  Some female species preferred males with more aggressive and repetitive calling, and D. microcephalus began calling more repetitively and rapidly when females were nearby 
(Schwartz and Wells 1985). Males will avoid note and call overlap because it impairs their ability to distinguish themselves to potential mates and prevents them from hearing and assessing their neighbor's calls 
(Schwartz 1987). Kaiser et al. (2011) found that anthropogenic noise decreases both the long- and short-term duration of individual male frog presence in the breeding chorus. Since females join the choruses later at night, the effect of increased exogenous noise is to decrease the time males and females overlap at the breeding pond. 
","

","
This species appears to be both abundant and increasing, and occurs within a number of protected areas 
(BolaÃ±os et al. 2008). It can tolerate disturbed habitat and has been found near roads and human settlements (BolÃ­var-G et al. 2009).  However, a study by Kaiser et al. (2011) found that anthropogenic noise had the effect of decreasing the amount of time males spent in the breeding chorus, both short-term and long-term.  This phenomenon may result in local declines.

The diploid chromosome number is 30 (Duellman, 2001).

Cardoso and Haddad (1984) discussed geographically coherent acoustic differences among populations. Kaplan (1994) suggested that Dendropsophus minutus is a complex of species. The general diagnosis is: head short, snout rounded; dorsum orange, brown or tan, usually with a pair of dorso-lateral stripes that can be simple or elaborate. Belly whitish. Throat yellow in males and white in females. Coloured thighs, mainly in the females. Tympanum indistinct (Cei 1980; Kwet 1999; Bastos 2003).
","
D. minutus has a widespread distribution from the lowlands east of the Andes from Colombia, Venezuela, and Trinidad southward through Ecuador, Peru and Brazil to Bolivia, Uruguay, until Argentina, up to 2000 m elevation (Frost 2004). This species may be considered very versatile, according to its wide range in latitude as well as in altitude (Cei 1980). It is an arboreal species but during breeding time it is commonly found in open grasslands near shallow waters.
","
Hemipterans and Aranaea are important components of the diet of D. minutus, but individuals of Homoptera and Diptera can also be part of the diet (Sluys & Rocha 1998). 

Males usually call from grass, emergent aquatic plants, or low shrubs next to the water. Their short, shrill calls produce loud mass concerts, heard from dusk until after midnight (Kwet 1999). Kwet (2001) registered a dominant frequency  of 3600-5800 Hz, and 4040-4840 Hz as maximum. Two mating strategies have been reported: the calling male and the satellite male (Haddad 1991). Territorial disputes were observed by Cardoso & Haddad (1984); different calls and physical combat behavior to defend calling sites have been observed by Haddad (1987). The amplexus is axilar. Egg-laying occurs in standing water bodies, such as ponds or large puddles. Spawning period from September to February (Kwet 1999). 
","
The larval morphology was studied by Vizotto (1967) and the microanatomy of the buccal apparatus and oral cavity were described by Echeverria (1997).  The tadpole is characterized by its high orange and black coloured tail fin and a dark line ranging from snout to eye. It is free-swimming and feeds mainly on algae (Kwet 1999). Tadpoles raised in laboratory were observed to feed on commercial fish food and plant material. Peixoto (1997) suggested that tadpoles of D. minutus could be facultatively carnivorous. 
","

","

","
Dendrosophus brevifrons differs by having a white horizontal bar below the eyes, and a brown dorsum without hourglass markings.

This species was previously within the genus Hyla but has recently been moved to the resurrected genus Dendropsophus (Faivovich et al. 2005). It is likely a complex of several species.

This species was featured as News of the Week on December 15, 2014.
An emerging biodiversity pattern is that of single amphibian species that are widespread across a continent are found to be complexes of several cryptic species. These are species that are difficult to distinguish without detailed analysis of traits such as mating calls in frogs or DNA sequences. An extreme example is the species Dendropsophus minutus, which extends over several ecoregions, including the wet forests of Amazonia, the coastal Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil, to dry scrub forest of the Caatinga. Depending on the region, the species occurs from sea level to 2000 m asl. Using mtDNA sequences, Gehara and 29 co-authors (2014) identified 43 lineages within the single ""species,"" many of which may represent cryptic species. The distribution of one lineage covers more than 1 million km2. This broad-brush study is an important first step in documenting taxonomic and biogeographic patterns of Neotropical biodiversity that beg for deeper analysis (Written by David Cannatella). 

This species was featured in News of the Week 14 August 2023:
Amphibians are found across a wide range of elevations, from sea level to above 5,000 meters, exposing them to a wide range of climates. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that organisms exposed to more temperate variation will be able to function across a wider range of temperatures. Bovo et al. (2023) tested the thermal tolerances of five species of frogs that are distributed across mountains in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest. They found differences among species in temperature tolerance, but did not always find that broader temperature variation at increasing elevations correlated with broader temperature tolerance. In addition, they did not find a consistent difference in water loss or water uptake across altitude or climates. Overall, they did not find strong support for the climate variability hypothesis or for elevation shaping these physiological traits. (MWomack)

A small frog. The snout-vent length varies from 18-23 mm in males and from 21-25 mm in females. Snout truncate or rounded. Head as long as wide. The tympanum is distinct and nearly circular. Nostrils dorsolateral. The dorsal surface is smooth. Hands with a distinct palmar tubercle; subarticular tubercles rounded. Prepollex distinct. Legs slender. Toes not robust. The color in life also varies, but almost all the specimens have a dark green or dark brown color pattern. A dark brown stripe bordered by a white stripe is visible on the flanks and canthus rostralis. Belly white. Toe and finger discs are reddish. Many specimens bear two divergent dorsal brown stripes, from the anterior section of the head to nearly the middle of the body (Napoli and Caramaschi 1999).
","
Dendropsophus rubicundulus lives in open areas, near temporary and permanent ponds. The species' distribution is associated with the biome Cerrado, in the States of Minas Gerais, GoiÃ¡s, Distrito Federal, Bahia, Tocantins, PiauÃ­ and in the far northern of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil (Napoli and Caramaschi 1999). 
","
This species can be found from October to January, at the forest edge and in open areas, such as grasslands, pasturelands and natural Cerrado fields (Brasileiro et al. 2008; pers. obs.).
Males of Dendropsophus rubicundulus call at the beginning of the night (19:00 to 21:00) from herbaceous vegetation, on branches or leaves (usually 40-50 cm above the ground) near temporary ponds (such as rain-filled pools, rice fields, farm ponds, and swamps) and permanent ponds (such as pools and rivulets) (Cardoso and Vielliard 1985; Haddad et al. 1988; Bastos et al. 2003).  The chorus size can vary from 10-40 calling males (pers. obs.). The advertisement call was described by Cardoso and Vielliard (1985) and Napoli and Caramaschi (1999). Call is composed of 2 notes; notes are given at the interval of 0.3s; note duration: 0.02s. The advertisement call can be heard in Toledo et al. (2008).  

Amplexus is axillary (Bastos et al. 2003). Adults lay eggs in lentic water bodies (reproductive mode 1 of Haddad and Prado, 2005); the tadpole is benthic and can be found from November to April (Barreto and Moreira 1996; pers. obs.).  Development lasts about 30 days (Barreto and Moreira 1996). 
","
The tadpole has a total length of 30 mm at Gosner stage 35. The body is depressed dorsoventrally in lateral view and violin-shaped in dorsal view; body length approximately 35% of total length; snout slightly triangular in dorsal and ventral views; nostrils large, elliptical. Spiracle sinistral, short, not projecting, located at the beginning of the posterior third of the body, with inner wall present. Vent tube short, dextral, attached to ventral fin. Tail has terminal flagellum; dorsal fin begins at the posterior edge of the body. Oral disc anteroventral reduced to U-shaped yoke around mouth and modified into a projecting tube. Papillae, denticles, and dermal ridges between the beak and lower lip are absent. 

In life, the tadpole body is reddish brown with a conspicuous median brown mark dorsally and a brown stripe from the tip of the snout through the eye to the posterior margin of the body. Tail pale brown anteriorly, reddish brown with yellowish spots posteriorly (Pugliese et al. 2001).
","
Its range is within several protected areas, specifically the Parque Estadual Nova Baden, at Lambari-MG, Floresta Nacional de Silvania, at Silvania-GO (Bastos et al. 2003), Parque Nacional da Serra do Cipo, at Jaboticatubas-MG (Pugliese et al. 2001), Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra, at Delfinopolis-MG (Haddad et al. 1988), Parque Nacional Grande Sertao Veredas, and others located in the Cerrado domain in the State of Minas Gerais, EstaÃ§Ã£o Ecologica de Aguas Emendadas, at Planaltina-DF  (Brandao and Araujo 1998)., Parque Nacional de Sete Cidades, at Piracuruca-PI (Annunziata et al. 2007). It is a relatively common species within its range (Brandao and Araujo 1998).

","
Dendropsophus rubicundulus belongs to the D. microcephalus species group (Faivovich et al., 2005); it was formerly placed in the D. rubicundulus species group (Napoli and Caramaschi 1999). 

Rabello (1970) and Gruber et al. (2005) reported a 30-chromosome karyotype in D. rubicundulus, with the majority being telocentric and subtelocentric chromosomes.

This species can be diagnosed by the following combination of characters: body size (females 34-37 mm SVL, males 24-29 mm SVL); smooth dorsal skin; axillary membrane present; fingers one-half webbed; toes two-thirds webbed; dorsum mottled dark and light brown; lighter markings of creamy white to golden yellow with irregular edges: broad light mark on snout, diagonal light mark running from eyelid to mid-flank, diagonal mark on shank; orange coloration on hands, feet, concealed surfaces of limbs, ventral surfaces of limbs; coppery bronze iris; males with yellow vocal sac and lacking nuptial pads; females with white throat (RodrÃ­guez and Duellman 1994). 

Similar species: D. sarayacuensis can be distinguished from D. leucophyllatus by coloration (mottled dark and light brown dorsum with white to golden yellow markings for D. sarayacuensis, vs. creamy tan dorsum with a dark brown hourglass marking for D. leucophyllatus.  D. sarayacuensis can be distinguished from D. triangulum by coloration (orange hands, feet, and concealed surfaces of limbs in D. sarayacuensis, vs. distinctly red webbing and red concealed surfaces of limbs in D. triangulum) (RodrÃ­guez and Duellman 1994).

Tadpoles reach a maximum total length of 22.5 mm, with 30% of that being body and 70% the tail.  The larval body is violin-shaped when viewed from above, with a tail ending in a long filament.  The snout is bluntly rounded when viewed from above.  Eyes are large and are laterally directed.  The oral disc is anterior and is bordered by a single row of papillae laterally and ventrally; denticles are absent.  Jaw sheats are finely serrated and are robust.  The dorsal tail fin does not extend onto the body and is slightly lower than the ventral tail fin.  The larval body is reddish brown to gray, with a metallic gold venter and a black or gray tail with black markings (RodrÃ­guez and Duellman 1994). For a drawing of the tadpole and a key to hylid tadpoles of the eastern lowlands of Colombia see Lynch and Mayorga (2011).
","
D. sarayacuensis inhabits the upper Amazon Basin, in Ecuador (Shreve 1935; Duellman 1972; Duellman and Pyles 1983; Pearman 1997; Bustamante et al. 2005), Peru (Toft and Duellman 1979; RodrÃ­guez and Duellman 1994; von May et al. 2008), Brazil (Heyer 1977; Aichinger 1987; Gascon and Pereira 1993; Galatti 1999; Bernarde et al. 2011), Colombia (Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996; Lynch 2005), and northwestern Bolivia (de la Riva et al. 2000); this species has also been reported from Cerro Neblina in the far southern part of Amazonas state, Venezuela (McDiarmid and Paolillo 1988; Barrio-AmorÃ³s 1998).  It is an arboreal species and can be found in understory vegetation in both primary and secondary rainforest, as well as at forest edges (La Marca et al. 2004).  It occurs at elevations up to 1,700 m asl (Bustamante et al. 2005).
","
This species is nocturnal and arboreal (La Marca et al. 2004). It is found on low vegetation <1.5 m above ground (Toft and Duellman 1979).  In life, this species has a distinctive herbal odor (RodrÃ­guez and Duellman 1994). 

Breeding takes place at forest pools (Duellman and Pyles 1983), and occurs only during the six month rainy season (Aichinger 1987). Aichinger (1987) found this species at Panguana (Upper Amazon Basin, Brazil) in a large temporary forest pond (filled throughout the rainy season) along with 22 other species.  Males call in choruses, with groups of 5-10 males (Aichinger 1987). Advertisement calls at Santa Cecilia, Ecuador were found to consist of a single note per call group with a single secondary note, at an average dominant frequency of 2.99 kHz (range 2.848-3.326 kHz) and an average pulse rate of 78 pulses/second (range 60-80); the note is repeated 26.8x per minute (range 22.2-33.3x), on average, and lasts 0.08 seconds (range 0.03-0.11 second) (Duellman and Pyles 1983).  RodrÃ­guez and Duellman (1994) reported that advertisement calls at Iquitos, Peru, consisted of a single primary note followed by one or two shorter notes.

Oviposition takes place during early morning, after rainfall, on the upper surfaces of leaves, moss-covered roots and tree trunks near or above the water (HÃ¶dl 1991; RodrÃ­guez and Duellman).  HÃ¶dl (1991) describes breeding behavior as follows: First, the male clasps the female and positions its cloaca directly above that of the female. Carrying the amplexed male, the female climbs to a vertical structure overhanging a water body. She deposits egg masses at regular intervals in an arching position.  Between each bout of egg deposition, she climbs 1 to 3 cm, resulting in a long series of successfully laid egg masses. Eggs are highly adherent, making brushing and smoothing of the clutch unnecessary. The whole process lasts between 17 to 34 minutes. According to HÃ¶dl (1991), an average of 141 eggs are laid during 5 to 8 bouts; the range is 68-176 eggs per clutch (RodrÃ­guez and Duellman). The egg jelly swells up by absorbing water from the humidity-saturated air and wet substrate.  Larvae fall into the water ten to thirteen days after oviposition (HÃ¶dl 1991).

The tadpole of D. sarayacuensis undergoes oral development resembling that of Hyla chrysoscelis until stage 24, when the oropharyngeal membrane ruptures (see Thibaudeau and Altig 1988 for scanning electron micrographs). The tadpole lacks a typical oral disc and labial teeth (denticles). Although vestigial labial tooth ridges are present throughout tadpole ontogeny, teeth never appear. By stage 25, serrated, fully keratinized jaw sheaths are present, as well as two large, lateral papillae, with posteriomedial papillae becoming evident soon thereafter.  Larvae of this species are thought to feed by tearing off suitable pieces of material from submerged substrates. 

This species is susceptible to infection by the cosmocercid nematode Cosmocerca brasiliense (also known as C. brasiliensis; Dyer and Altig 1976, 1977).
","

","
It is most common in Peru and Ecuador (La Marca et al. 2004).  It appears to be able to tolerate some habitat disturbance (La Marca et al. 2004).  It is known to occur within many protected areas, some examples of which follow. Within Ecuador, its range overlaps with a number protected areas, including Parque Nacional Sumaco Napo-Galeras, Parque Nacional YasunÃ­, and Reserva BiolÃ³gica Limoncocha (La Marca et al. 2004). Within Peru, it is found in Manu National Park (Rodriguez and Cadle 1990), as well as in protected areas (Cocha Cashu, Centro Sachavacayoc, Eco Amazonia, Explorerâ€™s Inn, and Pakitza) in the Madre de Dios region (von May et al. 2008).  In Brazil, it is found within the Reserva Extrativista Riozinho da Liberdade, Acre (Bernarde et al. 2011).
","
This species may be collected for the pet trade, although it is not clear whether specimens represent D. sarayacuensis or D. triangulum; Rowley et al. (2007) noted six individuals were imported into Hong Kong from Germany but did not distinguish between these species.  
","
First described by Shreve (1935); the name sarayacuensis refers to the type locality of Sarayacu, province of Pastaza, Ecuador.  Faivovich et al. (2005)  placed D. sarayacuensis in the leucophyllatus group with D. bifurcus, D. ebraccatus, D. elegans, D. leucophyllatus, D. rossalleni, and D. triangulum, and the analysis of Wiens et al. (2010) also supports this grouping.  Wiens and colleagues found that D. anceps did not cluster with this group, in contrast to the analysis of Faivovich et al. (2005).

Dendropsophus werneri is a small species whose females measure up to 22 to 23 mm in SVL. Males are typically smaller in length, 18 to 20 mm (Lutz 1973). The head is short with large protuberant eyes. The snout is short and rounded, but juts out slightly in cross-section. The canthus rostralis is distinct. The tympanum is visible, and is about two-fifths the diameter of the eye. Vomerine teeth are present in two small groups located between the choanae  
(Lutz 1973). Both fingers and toes are webbed.  Webbing between fingers is approximately one-third the length of the digits, and the webbing between toes is approximately three-fourths to almost the entire length  
(Duellman 1970; Lutz 1973). Hind limbs are relatively short. There are no dermal folds on the limbs, but they do possess an axillary membrane.  The ends of D. werneri digits terminate in expanded discs. Males have a small ridge on the outside of their first finger, though they lack nuptial pads. Males have single large median subgular vocal sacs. The dorsal skin texture is smooth with occasional pustules. The ventral skin and lower median area of the thighs are granular  
(Lutz 1973).   
 
The dorsum is generally cream to tawny in color with small brown aggregated markings. Some individuals have a grayish red dorsal surface and a rosy ventral surface with a yellow belly. Dorsal markings can occur in an elongated X-shaped pattern, or the entire dorsal surface may be covered with dark spots, or it may be nearly devoid of pattern, which is typical for pale specimens.  The sides of the head have a dark patch, and dark patches of dots are usually present on the knee and elbow. The visible portion of the thigh has short bars, while the concealed part of the thighs lacks patterning. Many individuals have vivid white spots below each eye, or occasionally under only one eye (Lutz 1973).    
 
The tadpoles have tails that narrow sharply into a flagellum-like appendage (Duellman 1970).
","
Dendropsophus werneri is common in southern and southeastern Brazil.  It is mostly located in lowlands but can be found up to 800 m above sea level. Its habitat is limited to areas of vegetation near bodies of water 
(Andrade et al. 2004).
","
This species is found near bodies of water, including flooded areas and abandoned agricultural fields. It can be located on the perimeter of forests during breeding season, but usually stays away from the interior of the forest. It tends to favor semi-permanent bodies of water, such as swamps, for breeding 
(Andrade et al. 2004). 
 
Dendropsophus werneri is a member of the Dendropsophus microcephalus group, which are known to breed in flooded areas during periods of high precipitation. Males of this group prefer to make their mating calls in low vegetation, such as grass or bushes. Eggs are laid on the waterâ€™s surface in small clusters, typically attached to aquatic-growing plants. In Brazil, adult members of this group are most commonly a form of arboreal species, but do not venture very high in trees when they do climb. Lutz 
 (1973) found male D. werneri sitting atop herbaceous vegetation.  Mating calls are reminiscent of an insect, occurring in a series: ""creek-eek-eek-eek."" The first sound is the primary note, followed in quick succession by repetitive secondary notes  
(Duellman 1970).  The call of D. werneri was observed to be very similar to that of D. meridianus (then referred to as Hyla misera meridiana)  
(Lutz 1973).
","

","
The species appears to be abundant (Andrade et al., 2004).[3900]
","

","
This species has undergone numerous name changes since it was first described in 1894 by Werner (1894)[4001] as Hyla pygmaea. It was later renamed after Werner as Hyla misera werneri  
(Cochran 1952). The name was changed to its current form, Dendropsophus werneri, in 2005  
(Faivovich et al. 2005).

Distinguished from all other Costa Rican hylids, with the exception of 
Hyla fimbrimembra, by the presence of dermal fringes along the 
posteroventral margins of the limbs (Savage and Heyer 1968).  It differs 
from H. fimbrimembra in lacking true integumentary-cranial 
co-ossification, although the presence of osteoderms belays a false impression 
of this character (Duellman 1970).  Other distinguishing features include 
fully webbed hands and feet, and tuberculate skin that is present in both 
juveniles and adults.  Adults have keratinized granules on their venter, and 
breeding males have protruding prepollical spines. The head is flat on top 
and rounded in dorsal outline, and the snout appears truncate in both dorsal 
and lateral outline.  The tympanum is about half the size of the eye, and above
 it a bony ridge followed by a dermal fold extends posteriorly to just above 
the arm's insertion.  The canthus is rounded and the internarial area is 
depressed.  Arms are short and robust, and the immense hand bears large discs.
  The legs are long and moderately robust, and the feet also bear large discs.
  Recorded snout-vent length measurements ranged from 57.2 to 106.0 mm for male
 adults, and 69.7 mm for the single collected female
 (all above descriptions from Duellman 1970). The dorsal coloration is mottled with dark brown, 
metallic green, and orange-tan, while ventral surfaces range from pink-tan to 
light-brown, except for the anal region which is creamy white.  The chin has 
white tubercles and dark brown spots, the tympanum, webbing, and discs are dark
 brown, and the iris is bronze with reddish-brown reticulations 
(all color descriptions from Duellman 1970). No call has been attributed to this
species, although a ""loud growl-like"" sound has been noted (Duellman 1970).




","
Collections of  H. miliaria have been extremely rare, thus a collecting 
bias limits the known distribution.  This species has been collected 
between 600 and 1200 m on both the Caribbean and Pacific highland slopes of 
western Panama and Costa Rica, and from an unknown locality in Nicaragua and 
central Colombia (Duellman 1970).  The habitat is humid rainforest, 
categorized in the Subtropical Rainforest Lifezone using the designations of 
Holdridge (1967). 




","
Very little information is available for H. miliaria.  The thick, rugose
 skin and presence of osteoderms may provide some protection against 
desiccation, perhaps enabling the frogs to live in a more arid microhabitat
 (Duellman 1970).   An arboreal lifestyle is indicated by the large discs
 and dermal fringes, the latter seeming to confer the ability of gliding 
although only two observations have provided evidence for this behavior.  The 
arboreal lifestyle and resilience to desiccation has been suggested as evidence
 for the Fringe-limbed treefrog's home in the forest canopy 
(Duellman 1970).  There is not enough data available to estimate 
species abundance.




","

","
Due to the extreme rarity of sightings and lack of demographic data for
 H. miliaria, it's conservation status remains unknown.




","

","
Older nomenclature refers to Hyla miliaria as H. immensa. For a
 summary of name history, refer to Duellman (1970).

The subspecies H. arborea arborea inhabits almost all of Europe. The northern margin of the range runs approximately from Denmark (Aarhus and Jutland), Sweden (Scania) and the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Lithuania (Vilnius City: 54Âº41'N, 25Âº17'E) through Byelorussia (approximately on the line: towns of Oshmyany - Uzda - Slutsk) to southern Russia. From there, the margin runs south- and south-eastwards approximately along the line Bryansk Province - Kursk Province - west of Byelgorod Province (Shebekino District), then southwards in Ukraine from Kharkov City to Dnepropetrovsk Province to Donetsk Province. In Crimea, the frog is known from the southern shore and the extreme northwest of the peninsula. The frog is absent from eastern and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France. H. arborea schelkownikowi lives in the Caucasus. Its northern range runs in Russia approximately from Krasnodar Region along the line Abrau Peninsula in Novorossiik District - Goryachii Klyuch Town - Maikop Town - Stavropol Region (Stavropol City: 45Âº03'N, 41Âº59'E). From there, the margin runs in Stavropol Region to the south-east and then to the east: North Ossetia to Chechnya to Daghestan. The subspecies is absent in the highlands of the Great Caucasus. The eastern part of the southern margin of the range runs from the Northern Turkey to Georgia and Azerbaijan. The southern margin of the range is insufficiently known. H. arborea kretensis lives in Crete, Rhodos, Aegean, Peloponnese and the west of Asia Minor; H. arborea molleri in Northwestern Spain and Portugal; H. arborea sarda in Corsica, Sardinia and Elba. 
The Common Tree Frog inhabits well-illuminated, broad-leafed and mixed forests, bushlands, gardens, vineyards, orchards, parks, lake shores and stream banks. Dark and dense forests are avoided. Meadows are primarily used for reproduction. In the southern areas of the European part of the range, i.e. in the forest steppe zone, the tree frog inhabits insular forests and dense vegetation of floodplains. In mountains, it lives only in forests and in more or less wet transformed landscapes, and sometimes penetrates the subalpine belt. Spawning occurs in stagnant waters such as lakes, ponds, swamps and reservoirs, sometimes even in ditches and puddles.






","
In suitable habitats in the southern part of the range this is a common amphibian. For example, in the south of the former Soviet Union up to 20 specimens per 100 m of pond shore may be counted in spring. After reproduction, the population density is maximum in river valleys covered with broad-leafed trees.
During the day, H. arborea usually sit on the stems and broad leaves of trees, bushes and large herbaceous vegetation. The frog is active primarily in the evening and at night, when it comes down to the ground from vegetation to forage and to rehydrate. During the autumn migration to hibernacula, H. arborea are active during the day. Hibernation occurs on land from September - December to February - early May, on land (in soil, burrows, heaps of stones and holes in trees). Reproduction occurs from April - May, but sometimes in March, June or even late July. As a rule, more males are found in breeding pools than females. Females enter pools after males and leave immediately after breeding. Clutch contains about 200-2000 eggs deposited in portions, usually having the form of small rounded clumps containing from 3 to 100 eggs. Metamorphosis occurs from June to September, depending on the geographic position of a locality. In some cases, the larvae overwinter and complete transformation the following summer. Young froglets in the first time remain on the shore climbing grass and small bushes. Hyla arborea prey mainly on insects. Its ability for long leaps makes it possible to forage on fast flying insects, which comprise a considerable proportion of its food. The frogs forage on land. During the breeding season, adults forage periodically on the shore and on high plant stems above the water surface.






","

","
The tree frog displays a considerable decline and extinction in the West and Central Europe. It is caused by loss of breeding habitats, habitat isolation and fragmentation, pollution and collecting by people, as well as climate changes. However, in many large areas of its southern part of the range, e.g. in Ukraine and the Caucasus, the species is not rare and does not display population declines.






","
Although some kinds of human activity lead to decline and extinction of populations of H. arborea (see above), construction of a system of fish ponds, ditches, channels etc. sometimes cause local increase in the number of this species.






","
Protection of habitats seems to be the most important method of conservation of H. arborea.

Hyla arenicolor adult frogs range from 32-57 mm in SVL.  It has rough warty skin which prevents desiccation.  Webbing is well developed but does not extend to the hind leg's fifth toe.  Toe pads are considerably enlarged.  It is distinguished from similar species by having a dark-edged light spot beneath the eye, instead of a dark bar running through the eye.  Dorsal coloration is brown to gray and randomly spotted, while ventral coloration is cream to orange-yellow.  This coloration aids in its ability to camouflage.  When exposed to sun, the dorsal coloration changes from being normally dark to a light gray.   (Stebbins 2003).

Hyla chrysoscelis is often confused with Hyla versicolor. The two species are actually identical except in distribution, call, and chromosomal count. H. chrysoscelis is diploid (N=2),  where as H. versicolor is tetraploid, (N=4).  
H. chrysoscelis is a relatively large treefrog that is usually gray or green in color.  The exact coloration is determined by the activities and environment of individuals and can therefore vary within the species. All individuals, however, have bright orange or yellow bits of color spotted with black along their hind legs (Conant and Collins 1998).

This frog occurs widely across much of the eastern United States. They range from central Texas in the south, as far north as Ontario, Canada and all the way out to the east coast, where they can be found in the panhandle of Florida and up north into Maine (Conant and Collins 1998).

 This moderately large North American frog is a wide-ranging species. The males are usually slightly smaller than the females. A pointed snout and flat head possessing two transverse rows of vomerine teeth are also observed. The toe pads on Hyla cinerea  are large. The hind feet display extensive webbing and have two metatarsal tubercles between the toes. Some populations have individuals that lack lateral stripes, but normally H. cinerea  exhibits a lateral white or yellow stripe from the jaw to the thigh on either side of the body. White or yellow spots are often scattered on the back. The external, subgular vocal sac is mostly white or yellow in males when not inflated. During breeding season, the sides of the sac may turn green.  
 The size of tadpoles ranges from 4.5-5.5 mm from hatching and may grow to 60 mm before metamorphosis in a 28-44 day span. Until tadpoles reach stage 25 or 26, they display continuous ontogenetic color changes. After this period, the body turns green and the venter turns yellow. The tail may have distinct yellow orbitonasal stripes, and dark mottling or reticulations. Large tadpoles sometimes retain the yellow interorbital stripe. A long tail, bulging lateral eyes, dextral anus and sinistral spiracle are other morphological features of the tadpole from this species.  
Adults of this species normally turn to an ashen gray color when in preservative. The normally unobserved dorsolateral stripes in living species also appear over the subcutaneous insertions of lymph-sac septa. After months in preservation, H. cinerea  displays a mostly dark green or brownish color 
(Conant and Collins 1998).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
 The habitats most likely to house H. cinerea are swamps, sloughs and weedy margins of lakes and ponds. The lower Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains and the lower Mississippi River drainage are ideal locations of the species' environment (Connant and Collins 1998) . The range in the Mississippi River extends from Louisiana and Mississippi to the floodplains of southern and eastern Arkansas, western Tennessee and Kentucky.  Southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois are also in this range. The Atlantic/Gulf Coastal range extends from the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia to the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Most of Alabama, Mississippi and all of Louisiana complete the range.  
Introduced populations of this frog have been documented in Puerto Rico

Langowski et al. (2018) revealed new insights on the biomechanics of how frogs attach to (and detach from) surfaces by examining the toe pads of the American Green treefrog (Hyla cinerea) with new technologies. Using a combination of histology, immunohistochemistry, and synchrotron micro-computer-tomography (l-CT), the researchers obtained an extremely detailed 3-D characterization of tree frog toe pads. All toe pads examined shared a general layout with a ventral collagen layer, collateral ligaments, a septum compartmentalizing the subcutaneous volume into a distal lymph space and a proximal gland space, and muscular structures. Perhaps most interestingly, the collagen layer can withstand a shear load of up to 6.5 N! Furthermore, the researchers hypothesize that the septum facilitates proximal peeling of the pad and detachment from surfaces. With this new knowledge, researchers can better explain the mechanics and physics behind frog climbing and expect that frog toe pads will help design biomimetic adhesives (Written by Molly Womack).

The permeable skin of amphibians makes them particularly vulnerable to chemicals in their environments, including salt, which can slow down development or even cause death at high enough levels. However, a few amphibians lay their eggs in brackish water, begging the question of how these critters survive salt exposure. In a recent study, Albecker and McCoy (2019) found that coastal populations of Hyla cinerea, the American Green Treefrog, survive better and grow faster in salty environments than their inland counterparts. The authors suggest that Green Treefrogs have evolved to tolerate high salt levels in part by shortening their larval period and reducing the length of time the tadpoles are exposed to high salt levels. Future studies may reveal how these coastal frogs process higher levels of salt with specialized physiology (Written by Rebecca Tarvin).

Amphibians are freshwater animals, and most species cannot survive in saltwater. However, there are populations of a North American treefrog (Hyla cinerea) that have adapted to tolerate moderate levels of saltwater and inhabit coastal, saltmarsh ecosystems. The question is, how? Albecker et al. (2021) used gene expression to identify physiological mechanisms that underlie saltwater tolerance in coastal Green Treefrogs. They report that coastal frog populations differentially expressed several osmoregulatory genes that encode ion transporters, cellular adhesion components, and cytoskeletal components. Interestingly, they found coastal frogs expressed the gene that encodes glycerol, which is a compatible osmolyte that may help reduce water loss in hyperosmotic environments, which is a potentially novel mechanism of saltwater tolerance in frogs. Collectively, these findings highlight novel pathways, which in coastal Hyla cinerea improve control over cellular water balance and cell volume and may lead to salt tolerance in freshwater organisms facing habitat salinization.

Adults range from 1.9-5.6 cm in length. Specimens are either greenish or brownish in color, often with dark stripes that often run the length of the body (Stebbins 2003). Males have a tan or greenish throat while the throat of females is typically white. Hyla eximia tadpoles have a brown dorsum with minute silvery-gold flecks, and a dark venter tinged with pale gold (Stebbins 2003). 
","
This species is generally found in the mountains (Sierra Madre Occidental to Guerrero) of Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico (Degenhardt 1996). Hyla eximia usually reside at high elevations, ranging from 900 m to 2900 m. This species is also found along streams, in wet meadows, in coniferous forests, and temporarily in roadside ditches. An isolated population exists in the Huachuca Mountains in Arizona. 
","
Breeding occurs during summer, starting during the rain in early July with metamorphosis generally occurring by late August. Newly hatched tadpoles are 4.9-5.2 cm in length with tails that compose roughly one half to two-thirds of their bodies. The tails slowly decrease and metamorphosis occurs when the tadpoles reach 38 mm (generally 6-11 weeks). The breeding period can be from two to eight days. Both long duration and ephemeral breeding sites have been found; site location is dependent on weather and density of predators in a given area. Eggs are laid in small clusters attached to vegetation (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish).

The species is widespread in Japan, Korea, China (Fujian, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, as well as Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), Northern Mongolia, the Russian Far East (the valleys of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers and their tributaries) and south to Lake Baikal (northernmost record, in a warm hollow of the Barguzin River valley: ca. 54Âº30'N, 110ÂºE). 
The species inhabits mixed and deciduous broad-leafed forests, bushlands, forest steppes, meadows and swamps. In forestless areas, the tree frog primarily inhabits river valleys with shrubs. It also occurs in settlements, even in several large cities. Spawning occurs in stagnant ponds, puddles, oxbow lakes, flooded quarries and lakes with dense herbaceous vegetation. The eggs are sometimes deposited in river and stream pools.

This tree frog is a common, sometimes abundant amphibian, except in the northern parts of its range. The overall population density probably decreases from the south to the north, e.g. from the southern to the northern part of the Amurland. 
Hibernation probably occurs from September-October to April - May (sometimes June) on land, with individuals taking refuge in leaf litter, rodent burrows, holes in trees, under stones, etc. Reproduction occurs later than in many other syntopic amphibians, in May - August, in relatively warm water. Males enter ponds earlier than females. They call in a similar manner to the Common Tree Frog (Hyla arborea). The mating call has notes lasting 0.1-0.2 seconds at an interval of 0.2-0.5 seconds.  The fundamental frequency is 1.7 kHz, with clear harmonics. Breeding choruses occur not only at night but also during the day.  
 
An and Waldman (2016) found that Hyla japonica males with natural infections of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis called longer and made more rapid calls than did uninfected males. This may have two effects, which are possibly interrelated. Because female frogs are generally attracted to males that call longer and faster, pathogen transmission might be enhanced. Alternatively, the altered calls might result from selection on males for early reproductive success in anticipation of a premature death. However, it is unknown whether Japanese tree frog females actually prefer infected males. 

The clutch contains about 340-1500 eggs deposited singly or in a few clumps of 7-100 eggs. Females deposit their eggs both by day and night. Recently deposited spawn usually floats on the water surface. Some eggs are deposited on submerged plants. Metamorphosis occurs in summer or autumn; in some cases the tadpoles hibernate. Sexual maturity is attained probably in the 3rd-4th year of life. The majority of adults are 4-6 years old, but the maximum longevity is estimated as 6-11 years. 

Newly metamorphosed froglets prey upon Aphidinea and Cicadodea, whereas adult frogs feed on spiders and various insects. Active foraging occurs at twilight; during the day, frogs catch only the insects which approach them. This species feeds on spiders, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and larval Lepidoptera.

The Japanese Tree Frog seems not to be declining throughout its range, except for some peripheral northern populations.

The general area occupied by H. meridionalis in Europe extends from
 S France and NW Italy, to S Portugal and Spain, including Menorca, in the
 Balearic Islands, and the Canary Islands. Its European range includes two main general groups of
 populations.  A southern group occupies S and W Spain and Portugal, and
 a northern group extends from NE Spain and S France to NW Italy.  The 
southern group occupies mainly Central and S Portugal and SW Spain; it is
 prolonged eastwards by three discontinuous groups of populations.  One
 group occurs along the Spanish Mediterranean coast from the provinces of
 Huelva and CÃ¡diz to the region of Murcia.  The second group inhabits Sierra 
Morena on the southern slopes of the Central Plateau.  And the third group
 runs along the Tajo River, which acts as a corridor for the penetration of
 the western populations inside the Central Plateau, across the provinces
 of Toledo and Avila.  The northern group of populations is separated from
 the southern one by a long gap across the E Spanish Mediterranean coast 
from Murcia to CataluÃ±a.  This group shows populations in the eastern 
portions of CataluÃ±a in NE Spain, in a wide area of S France, and across
 the Liguria region to the province of Genova in NW Italy.  The populations
 from S France are widely spread along the Mediterranean coast, running 
along the RhÃ´ne Valley as far as the Dr6me, and along the southeastern 
slopes of the Massif Central as far as the northwestern portions of the 
Charente-Maritime dÃ©partement.  Some isolated populations have been reported
 from the south of the Landes region, in the dÃ©partement of 
PyrenÃ©es-Atlantiques in France and in the Basque Country in Spain.
 H. meridionalis is also present in the Balearic Archipelago
 but restricted to Menorca Island, where it occurs throughout the island.
 Little is known of the northern limits of the range.  In Iberia its
 distribution seems to be limited by the cold and dry regions of the
 Central Plateau, but the northwestern and eastern limits along the 
coasts are uncertain.  There is no actual continuity between the 
populations of the northern Mediterranean coast and the southern
 Mediterranean ones.  The northern and the southwestern limits of its
 distribution in France are uncertain. H. meridionalis is usually
 found at low altitudes, from sea level up to 450 m in Portugal and 650m 
in France.  Exceptionally it can exceed 1000 m in NE Spain (Montseny, 
province of Barcelona), and S France (Gasc 1997).
H. meridionalis also occurs in NW Africa. Here it occurs in 
the humid Mediterranean regions of the Mahgreb. In Morocco it occurs
 in the Moyen et Haut Atlas. It is found up to an altitude of 2650 m 
in Oukaimedene in the Haut Atlas (Schleich et al. 1996).
 A morphologically
 different form is found in the Anti Atlas Mountains the southernmost 
part of the range of the species (Bons and Beniez 1996). 








","
Mating occurs in March and April in North Africa, while the European 
populations mate from April to June (France) or from December to January 
(Portugal). Males call from water as well as from land and trees. The
 individual call is a deep, resonant ""Cra-a-ar"", repeated not much faster
 than every second and typically much slower (Burton and Arnold 1978).
 Calling can also occur in duo's, trio's or choruses, and is sometimes
 deafening. Calling can be heard from kilometers away during the calling 
peak in the breeding season. Amplexus lasts several hours to some days. 
Fleeing reactions are greatly reduced in mated couples. For oviposition 
they prefer plant accumulations near the shore. The female searches an 
object to attach her eggs to and expulses some spawn. This is the signal 
for the male to dip his hindbody down and inseminate the eggs. Oviposition
is repeated at many places until the female has no more eggs to expel. Even
 then she continues to act as before, but when the male notes that there 
are no more eggs he quits. When breeding is finalized the frogs leave the 
vicinity of the water and move away into trees etc. where they call mainly 
during the afternoon or evening hours until aestivation begins. 
The eggs are 800-1000 in number, deposited in lumps of 10-30 each, mostly 
on plants, but some sink to the bottom. Ovum diameter is 1.1 to 1.5mm, with
 a gelatinous envelope of 3-5mm. Tadpoles hatch after 8-10 days with a total
 length of 5-8mm. The tadpoles have high fins relative to their total length.
 They grow up to 4cm, with a maximum of 5.5cm. Metamorphosis occurs 3-4 months
 after hatching. The diet consists of various arthropods like spiders, bugs,
 beetles, butterflies, flies and ants, which are caught from ambush by day
 and by foraging at night (Schleich et al. 1996).








","

","
The main areas of distribution of the species in SW Iberia and S France seem
 to maintain a relatively high number of populations, although the rapid 
destruction of breeding biotopes and the intense use of pesticides, both
 a consequence of the loss of traditional agricultural methods, could 
modify the present situation in a short period of time. The populations 
of the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the isolated populations in 
the Basque Country could be considered the most endangered populations 
in Spain. The latter, limited to a few ponds in sandy soil, have recently 
been recorded again, but the possibilities of continuity appear to be very low
 (Gasc 1997). 
Honnegger (1981) notes that the species is suffering 
from an intensive anti-mosquito campaign along the Mediterranean coast.

Males 32-51 mm, females 33-60 mm (Wright and Wright 1949). In general, these frogs have warty skin and prominent adhesive pads on their fingers and toes (Johnson 1987). Their color can vary from green to light green-gray, gray, brown or dark brown (Johnson 1987). Usually, a large irregular star or spot appears on the back (Wright and Wright 1949) A large white spot is always present below each eye (Johnson 1987), although it is less visible and more of an olive color in females (Wright and Wright 1949).  The belly is white (Johnson 1987). Males have pale flesh-colored vocal sacs (Wright and Wright 1949).  In males, the chin is similar to the belly, with blackish spots (Wright and Wright 1949).  In males, the legs are yellow or orange-yellow ventrally. (Johnson 1987), whereas in females, the back of the forelegs, hindlegs and sides are a pale olive gray  
(Wright and Wright 1949).  
 
The tadpole is approximately 50 mm long, with a long tail. The coloration is scarlet or orange vermilion with black blotches around the edge of the crests  
(Wright and Wright 1949). 
","
 Hyla versicolor  can be found in Maine, southern Canada (west to Manitoba), Minnesota, South Dakota, southern Kansas, Oklahoma, the Gulf States and northern Florida. It can also be found in parts of Texas and Arkansas (Wright and Wright 1949).  
In Canada, the frog occurs in southern Quebec, southern, central and northwestern Ontario and south-eastern and central Manitoba. There is also an isolated population in Fredericton, New Brunswick  
(Cook 1984). 
 This treefrog is found in small wood lots, in trees along prairie streams, in large tracks of mixed hardwood forest, and in the bottomland forests along rivers and swamps(Johnson 1987).Hyla versicolor has been observed living in the tree canopies as high as 20.5 meters above ground. It is speculated that the frog is utilizing cooler, wetter micro-habitats in the mid-canopy region of the forest. 
","
The orange-yellow coloration on the back of the frog's legs is considered a ""flash"" coloration - it is only seen when the frog leaps, when it exposes the underside of the leg, and then is covered when it resumes a sitting position. The sudden flash of contrasting color is thought to confuse predators  
(Cook 1984). 
Breeding season begins at the end of April and ends in August, with breeding events typically concentrated during spring rains in May and June (Oldfield and Moriarty 1994). The female lays approximately 30 to 40 eggs of a brown and cream or yellow color in small scattered masses or packets on the surface of quiet pools. The eggs, measuring about 1.1-1.2 mm, are attached to the vegetation. Hatching occurs at 4-5 days
(Wright and Wright 1949). 

This frog is freeze-tolerant (Schmid 1982; Storey and Storey 1985).

Hyla versicolor has been found to be significantly less prone to infection by the trematode parasite Ribeiroia ondatrae than the sympatric species Bufo americanus, with metamorphic treefrogs harboring far less of a trematode parasite load and little associated mortality or deformities.  H. versicolor may have higher immunity to this parasite (Johnson and Hartson 2009).
","

","
This species is classified as Least Concern.  However, habitat preservation is still important.  Hyla versicolor requires terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites as well as the breeding wetlands, with a minimum suggested terrestrial habitat buffer of 60 m surrounding the main breeding pond (Johnson and Semlitsch 2003). 

H. versicolor is one of the frog species which has been used to demonstrate the insufficiency of many of the pesticide studies conducted by pesticide manufacturers under current EPA regulations.  H. versicolor tadpoles are susceptible to mortality from exposure to low concentrations of the pesticide carbaryl, with 10-60% of carbaryl-exposed tadpoles dying in laboratory experiments.  This mortality rate shoots up to 60-90% if the tadpoles are simultaneously exposed to both stress and low concentrations of carbaryl, with stress induced experimentally by placing a caged predator in the water (Relyea and Mills 2001). Thus studies examining only low concentrations of pesticide without considering synergistic effects from other factors may be highly likely to underestimate the negative effects of the pesticide.
","

","
 Hyla versicolor  is the sibling species of  Hyla chrysoscelis  (Cope's Gray Treefrog). These two species are indistinguishable based on external morphology (Conant and Collins 1991). Distinction can be made on the basis of the calls, erythrocyte (red blood cell) size (Matson 1990), and chromosomal complement (Conant and Collins 1991).  H. versicolor  is a genetic tetraploid, whereas  H. chrysoscelis  is diploid. The precise distribution of each species is not well established (Conant and Collins 1991). 
 In many areas, these two species live sympatrically (occuring together), and if they do, these species may interbreed  
(Bartlett and Bartlett 1999).   
 Perhaps the most striking feature of this frog is its ability to change color to match its environment (metachrosis) - a process which usually requires about half an hour (Logier 1952).

Hyla versicolor has long been known to use tree canopies. However, Laughlin et al. (2017) recently discovered that the treefrogs use natural habitats much higher than previously recorded, more than 12 meters above ground. The authors initially set up passive-infrared sensor camera traps to study white pine (Pinus strobus) canopy ecology but unexpectedly captured night images of H. versicolor at 18 meters high on four separate occasions over 14 months. The images of H. versicolor were always associated with southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans), which were more likely to be sensed by the cameras than the small ectothermic frogs. During that time, the researchers also directly observed another H. versicolor individual during a summer day at 20.5 meters. The researchers speculate that the frogs are utilizing cooler, wetter microhabitats in the mid-canopy that allow them to maintain these heights during the day and at night. These observations highlight the need for natural history information on H. versicolor and on the non-breeding habitats and behavior of amphibians in general (Written by Ann T. Chang).

The physical properties of our environments greatly affects how all organisms interact with the physical world. The surface tension of water is no exception. Schwenk and Phillips (2020) show that surface tension can actually prevent small tadpoles from breaching the surface of water to breathe air. Instead, tadpoles perform a newly described form of air-breathing they call ""bubble-sucking"", during which tadpoles carefully suck down a bubble from the waterâ€™s surface. As tadpoles grow, they are eventually able to overcome this constraint and begin breaching the surface to breathe. Phillips et al. (2020) report that Gray Treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) do not follow these trends, and instead bubble-suck throughout ontogeny, even after they are large enough to breach the surface. They found that tree frog tadpoles not only never breach, but after growing to a certain size, begin breathing with a novel form of bubble-sucking the authors coin ""double bubble-sucking"". Double bubble-sucking includes an extra breathing cycle which appears to greatly increase the efficiency of air-breathing by separating freshly breathed air from the residual air already in the lungs. The authors find that tree frog tadpoles transition from normal bubble-sucking to double bubble-sucking at the same body size that the lungs suddenly become well-vascularized, suggesting the change in breathing mechanics is linked to a change from non-respiratory air-breathing to respiratory air-breathing. Check out media coverage of these articles in Sciencedaily and Popular Science.

Hyla wrightorum is a species of frog with a snout-vent length of 19 â€“ 51 mm. It has a blunt snout, with a prominent and smooth canthus rostralis that curves inwards. The nostrils sit underneath the edge of the canthus rostralis. The distance between the nostrils is about equal to the distance between the nostril to the eye. The region around the nostrils is somewhat raised. There is a faint shallow groove between the nostrils. The skin is smooth on the back, granular on the underside. There is primitive webbing between the first three fingers, and no webbing on between the other fingers. The fingertips are slightly enlarged. The legs are relatively long, and the toe tips are smaller than the fingertips. The tarsal fold is prominent, as are the inner and outer metatarsal tubercles. The feet are slightly webbed. Two proximal subarticular tubercles are found on the fourth toe. The supernumerary tubercles on the hands and feet are prominent (Taylor 1938, Stebbins 2003).

It is similar to H. eximia in appearance, though it is larger in size, has longer legs, a wider and less pointed head, a relatively longer first finger, a darker lower jaw, and a lighter colored thigh. Additionally, H. wrightorum has a shorter, higher frequency call than H. eximia (Taylor 1938).

In life, it has a bright green back, with a dark line running down the sides from the nostril, to the eye and tympanum, and sometimes even down to the groin, that may be broken up into smaller sections. The underside is golden and orange, with a slight hint of green. There are uneven dark brown spots and stripes on the arms, legs, and back, as well as dark stripes on the legs and upper arms. The iris is a metallic brown color. In preservative, the backside is gray and lavender in color. The line running down each side is brown, as are the spots and stripes on the back and the limbs. The underside is white, with faint pigmentation on the chin, throat, and the underside of the limbs. The upper legs and groin show some slight brown pigmentation (Wright and Wright 1933, Taylor 1938, Duellman 1970).

The dark spots on the back are highly variable between individuals. Additionally, the dark line running down the sides is broken up differently between individuals (Wright and Wright 1933, Taylor 1938, Duellman 1970).
","
It is found from the mountains of central Arizona, specifically the Petran Montane Conifer Forest Biome along the Mogollon Rim, southeastward to the western part of central New Mexico. There is also an isolated population in Huachuca Mountains, Cochise County, Arizona, that extends southward to the Sierra Madre Occidental of Chihuahua, Mexico. It may extend to the region just north of Mexico City, though this is uncertain due to difficulties differentiating between this species with the similar H. eximia within this contact zone. It has an altitudinal range of 910 â€“ 2900 m asl (Sullivan 1986, Hammerson 2004).
","
It frequents ponds, slow-moving streams, and other relatively lentic bodies of water in semi-arid regions by pine and fir forests. It can be found on the ground or on trees and other vegetation. Breeding occurs in slow-moving bodies of water. Males call during the breeding season, and the dominant frequency is of their call is inversely proportional to their snout-vent length. The average dominate frequency was 1.86 kHz and ranged from 1.70 - 2.30 kHz with a pulse rate between 83.0 - 156.0 p/s and a call duration lasting between 0.13 - 0.24 seconds (Sullivan 1986, Hammerson 2004).
","

","
It is assumed to be common within its range. No other information is available on trends and threats in this species (Hammerson 2004).

The species authority is: Taylor, E. H. (1938). ""Frogs of the Hyla eximia group in Mexico, with descriptions of two new species."" University of Kansas Science Bulletin, 25(19), 421-445.

It is part of the H. eximia species complex. Taylor originally described it as a separate species from H. eximia in 1938, before being reassigned as a subspecies of H. eximia in 1953 by Schmidt, and subsequently as a subspecies of Pseudacris regilla in 1966 by Jameson et al. In 1977, Renaud suggested that H. wrightorum is indeed its own separate species, which was later confirmed in 2001 by Duellman (Sullivan 1986, Gergus et al. 2004, Hammerson 2004).

The specific epithet, wrightorum, is named after American herpetologists Anna Allen Wright and Albert Hazen Wright (Taylor 1938).

The existence of two disjoint populations, one extending from central Arizona into central western New Mexico, and the other from southern Arizona to Mexico, has led to measurable genetic variation between allopatric individuals. However, it is not enough to fully elevate either population to its own species, suggesting the populations were separated relatively recently (Gergus et al. 2004).

Coloration is pale-green to pale-brown above, and bluish-green on the venter, 
with a creamy line on the edge of the upper eyelid, the supratympanic fold, and
 the canthus (Duellman 1970). 

This species can immediately be distinguished from 
other Middle American hylids by the presence of an oval-shaped mental gland on
 the chin.  The iris is pale brown, bones appear greenish through the skin, and
 a yellow anal stripe runs transversely.  The skin is smooth except for weak 
granulation on the ventral thighs and belly. 

 The head is flat on top, the snout appears acutely rounded in dorsal outline and bluntly rounded in lateral 
profile, and the canthus is angular.  The tympanum is approximately half the 
size of the eye, and a dermal fold arches from the eye, over the tympanum, to 
a point above the arm's insertion.  The fingers are 1/3 webbed and bear small 
discs, while the toes are about 4/5 webbed and also bear small discs.  Adult 
male snout-vent length begins around 31.9 mm and reaches a maximum of 37.0 mm, 
whereas females range from 36.7 to 43.3 mm 
(all above descriptions based on Duellman 1970). 

The tadpole is ovoid, with a relatively shallow 
dorsal fin that does not extend onto the body.  A large, ventral mouth is 
present, completely bordered by two rows of oral papillae, with bluntly 
serrated beaks, and six upper and nine lower rows of teeth (with some 
variation).  The spiracle is sinstral, at a point midlength and midline along 
the body, and the anal tube is dextral
 (all tadpole morphology from Duellman 1970).

 The mating call has been described as a ""series of 
short, high pitched, cricket-like chirps,"" where the notes are produced in 
rapid succession (Duellman 1970).

","
Hyla colymba is found on the Caribbean slopes of western Panama and Costa 
Rica, on the Pacific slopes of eastern Panama and Ecuador, and presumably in 
Colombia (Duellman 1970).  It occupies an elevational range between 600 and 
1400 m, what has been described as the Subtropical Rainforest Lifezone 
(Holdridge 1967).  Typical habitat lies in close proximity to streams of 
humid, lower montane forest or cloud forest, and tadpoles are commonly found 
within quiet of small rocky streams (Duellman 1970).

","
Few life history observations have been reported for H. colymba.  It has
 been noted that males are extremely wary, calling and remaining in retreat 
under large boulders, and ceasing calls at any slight disturbance 
(Duellman 1970). 

","

","
No population records have been obtained for H. colymba, and thus its 
conservation status, and any potential threats, remain unknown.

","

","
Hyla alvaradoi is synonymous with H. colymba; see 
Duellman (1970) for remarks.

Dorsal coloration consists of brown blotches or tan spots that are variable to
 uniform, and the ventral surface is yellow (Savage and Heyer 1968).
  Upper limb is barred, an ivory stripe extends from seat to heel, and yellow
 or brown melanophores are scattered on the plantar foot surface and 
anterior/posterior thigh.  Some individuals have blue-purple coloration on the
 flank and yellow groin spots.  Coloration may be confused with Sordida
 puma, but absence of dark groin and flank reticulum, and absence of
 distinct light and dark foot to tarsal stripe in H. pseudopuma is
 diagnostic.  Individuals may also be confused with Smilisca sordida,
 but bright yellow groin spots and brown or yellow posterior thigh of
 H. pseudopuma are characteristic differences.  The dorsum is relatively
 smooth and the ventral surface is granular, and a series of warts may be
 present along the lower arm.  The iris is gold and the pupil is horizontal,
 the tympanum is distinct, and the snout is rounded and truncate with a median
 projection in dorsal outline.  Vomerine teeth arise at the level of the
 posterior choanae and extend posteriorly.  Prepollex is not protuberant,
 fingers are approximately one-third webbed (vestigal between I and II) and
 bear large discs.  Toes are about two-thirds webbed, and bear discs smaller
 than those of the fingers.  Males have internal vocal sacs that are paired
 and lateral, and brown nuptial asperities extending to the thumb's disc 
(all information from Savage and Heyer 1968).  The subspecies 
H. pseudopuma infuncata tends to be slightly larger than 
H. pseudopuma pseudopuma, but more diagnostic is the bluntly round
 snout (due to structural differences in the underlying premaxillaries) and
 red flash of color found on the thighs and webbing of H. pseudopuma
 infuncata (Duellman 1970).  Males range in size from 37.6 to 42.9 mm,
 and the slightly larger females measure between 41.1 and 45.6 mm 
(Duellman 1970). The mating call may consist of a single note or a
 series of short notes, generally low and poorly modulated, with a repitition
 rate of 45 notes per minute (Duellman 1970).


","
H. pseudopuma is common throughout Costa Rica and Panama, and found in
 both disturbed and undisturbed habitats (Crump 1991).  The range
 stretches from Northwestern Panama through the cordilleras of Costa Rica,
 within moderate altitudes (Savage and Heyer 1968).  Two subspecies are
 recognized, H. pseudopuma pseudopuma and H. pseudopuma infuncata,
 with the former occurring in the highlands of Costa Rica and the Pacific
 slopes of western Panama and the latter restricted to the Atlantic slopes of
 western Panama (Duellman 1970).



","
H. pseudopumais active throughout the year, foraging during the night.
  During the day they are found secreted in bromeliads or elephant-eared plants,
 and at night (when not breeding) they are found in small bushes and trees
(Duellman 1970).  The breeding season corresponds to the rainy season,
 running between May and October.  H. pseudopuma breeds explosively
 following heavy rains, at which time they congregate at ephemeral ponds and
 pools, often completing breeding within 24 hours 
(Crump and Townsend 1990).  Males call to females from the water,
 preferentially deep water, and females respond with apparent size-random mate
 choice (Crump 1991; Crump and Townsend 1990).  There is a strong
 male-biased sex ratio (Crump 1991), and male-male competition (in the
 form of mating balls) has been observed during the breeding season 
(Crump and  Townsend 1990).  Females control the final sites of egg
 depostion, and Crump (1991) demonstrated that selection for oviposition
 sites occurred based on presence of tadpoles, water depth, and possibly
 density of eggs.  Multiple small egg masses (each group usually less than
 500 eggs) are deposited at several locations within a pond or puddle, 
attached to emergent and submerged vegetation, with a total of 1800-2500 eggs
per female (Crump 1991).  Tadpoles primarily feed on plant matter and
 detritus found within the breeding pools (Crump 1990).  In addition,
 H. pseudopuma tadpoles (generally 23-28 mm in total length with 
well-developed hind legs) opportunistically cannibalize both heterospecific 
and conspecific eggs and early hatchlings (Crump 1983).  Controlled 
studies by Crump (1990) have demonstrated that H. pseudopuma 
tadpoles which fed on conspecifics weighed more than those fed on 
heterospecifics, an indication that some particular advantage is obtained from
 conspecific cannibalism.  Tadpoles have shown some degree of phentoypic
 plasticity, metamorphosizing early in response to simulated pond drying
 (at the cost of smaller body size) as compared to more prolonged development
 in a constant environment (Crump 1989). Tadpole predation occurs
 naturally by several invertebrate species, including adult dytiscid beetles
 (Rhantus guticollis), odonate naiads (Aeshinasp. and 
Sympetrum nigrocreatum), and notonectids (Crump 1984).

Declines have been reported for populations within the Monteverde region of
 Costa Rica's Cordillera de Tilaran, where an unprecedented crash led to the
 decline of 25 of 53 amphibian species during 1990 (Pounds et al. 1997).
  Here, where H. pseudopuma was found in the hundreds throughout the
 1980s, the maximum number found was 43, significantly below the precrash
 levels (Pounds et al. 1997).  The causal explanations that have been
 proposed have focused climatic factors in a direct or synergistic manner.
  Pounds and Crump (1994) proposed several climate-based hypotheses for
 other frogs effected within the area (namely Bufo periglenes and 
Atelopus varius): the moisture stress, temperature stress, 
climate-linked epidemic, and the climate-linked contaminant pulse hypothesis.
  More recent studies have linked Monteverde's declines to more subtle, but
 cumulative weather changes caused by global warming.  Particularly, Pounds et
 al. (1999) analyzed precipitation, air temperature, sea surface 
temperature, and stream flow patterns in relation to communities of tropical
 anurans, birds, and anoline lizards. Their conclusions resolved that it was
 not simply the effect of the El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation, as Pounds and 
Crump (1994) had earlier hypothesized, but rather a larger warming trend
 (this trend remained significant with the El NiÃ±o fluctuations included) which
 crossed a threshold in late 1980's and precipitated a broad tropical anuran
 decline.  Declines were evident in the anoline lizard communities as well, and
 the tropical avian communities underwent significant restructuring. Earlier
 studies noted the particular sensitivity of H. pseudopuma tadpoles to
 drying conditions.  As Crump (1991) noted, the ephemeral nature of the
 breeding ponds is subject to evaporation, which often leads to complete egg
 dessication and total tadpole mortality.  In addition, environmental 
conditions that confine tadpoles to shallow pools may cause significant stress.
  Laboratory experiments conducted by Crump (1989) demonstrated how 
tadpoles grown in shallow water took much longer to develop than individuals
 raised in deeper water, possibly resulting from overcrowding.

Green above with irregular bronze colored blotches, although there is variation 
 in hues and the degree of blotching.  Dorso-lateral skin fold is creamy,  
running from eye to groin though sometimes discontinuous.  It is paralleled 
 by a black canthal stripe that begins at the nostril and extends over the 
 conspicuous tympanum to the groin.  A white glandular stripe extends from 
 the mouth to the base of the forearm.  Flanks are brown with cream spots, 
 and limbs are bronze to brown in color.  Hind-side of thighs and groin are 
 bright blue, and the belly is whitish.  The skin is relatively smooth above, 
 and it is granular below.  Fingers lack webbing, while toes are almost fully 
 webbed, and discs are conspicuous on both.  Between the internal nasal openings 
 (choanae), vomerine teeth are distinct.   A pectoral fold is present 
 (Cogger 1996). 
Reproductively mature males have thumbs that are 
 swollen through the development of nuptial pads (Pyke 1999). Males range 
 from 57 to 69 mm, while females range from 65 to 108 mm in length (Barker et al. 1995).

Found primarily at lower altitudes in eastern and southeastern New South Wales, Australia, 
 as well as far eastern Victoria.  It has been introduced to New Zealand and a 
 number of other Pacific Islands where it is locally abundant 
 (Medway and Marshall 1975).  Prefers freshwater habitat, where the 
 water bodies are still, shallow, unshaded, ephemeral, and unpolluted 
 (Pyke and White 1996).  Inhabited water bodies are generally isolated and 
 free of native fish species.  Individuals disperse and forage over large areas, and 
 diverse terrestrial habitats.  Emergent aquatic vegetation, such as reeds and 
 rushes, furnish foraging and basking habitat, and nearby grassy areas provide 
 the principal feeding ground (Pyke 1999).

These frogs are non-climbers, and are commonly found perched on aquatic vegetation near breeding sites.  Individuals are active during the day, and breed during the summertime (October though March, though as early as August). Males call from the water.  Females deposit between three and ten thousand eggs in a floating gelatinous mat, which sinks after 6-12 hours.  Tadpoles hatch around two days, and immature froglets appear around two months (Pyke 1990). 

Their deep growling call has been described as a slow gutteral four-part 'craw-awk, crawk, crok, crok' (Cogger 1996). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Larvae are large at metamorphosis, with a high tail fin and heavy pigmentation, typical of Litoria (Barker et al. 1995). 

Tadpole diet includes bacteria, algae and organic detritus, while adult frogs feed on almost anything, including insects and other frogs (Pyke 1990).  In short, the frogs are a voracious, cannibalistic species.   
 
 
","
During the 1950's, Green and Golden Bell Frogs were abundant throughout New 
 South Wales, in such numbers that they were commonly collected for dissection 
 experiments and as food for captive snakes (White and Pyke 1996).  Rapid 
 declines were first noticed in the early 1990's, and extensive surveying has 
 been conducted to locate sites and document population trends.  The research of 
 White and Pyke (1996) indicated a severe loss of populations throughout 
 New South Wales after 1990, specifically the disappearance of frogs from 113 
 of a recorded 137 sites.  The best long-term documentation comes from White's 
 population records of the Eastlakes in Sydney, demonstrating a consistent 
 decline from 138 adult frogs in 1968 to only 3 in 1993  
(White and Pyke 1996).     The most probable causes for decline 
 include habitat fragmentation, drainage alteration, and the introduction of 
 predatory fish.  A number of studies have shown correlation between  
L. aurea declines and the increasing distribution of Gambusia 
 holbrooki (the ""Mosquito Fish""), a native to North America that was 
 introduced to control mosquito larvae.  Morgan and Buttemer (1996) 
 conducted laboratory experiments which demonstrated the high susceptibility 
 of  L. aurea  tadpoles to predation by G. holbrooki, 
  particularly small, newly hatched tadpoles.  UVB experimentation  
(van de Mortel and Buttemer 1996) has not demonstrated any significant 
 susceptibility of L. aurea to radiation exposure.

This species was featured in news of the week on August 29, 2022:
Cities, suburban gardens, and other human modified areas are drastically different from frogsâ€™ natural habitats. They are often warmer, noisier, artificially brighter, and more polluted. Gathering the data needed to understand whether frogs are adapting their behaviours to cope with these conditions is challenging, but increasingly, citizen science data is allowing us to investigate large-scale ecological questions like this. Liu et al. (2022) analysed over 226,000 frog records from across Australia to examine whether human-driven habitat modification influences the breeding phenology or call characteristics of frogs. They found that frog breeding seasons began earlier and were almost 3 weeks longer in areas that were highly modified by humans. However, habitat modification did not affect frog call characteristics. Their results suggest that human-induced phenological changes could be widespread among frogs, with largely unknown ecological consequences. This research also highlight the incredible value of citizen science data in better understanding amphibians in a changing world. (Written by Gracie Liu)

Lysapsus limellum is a small Hylid frog with a snout-vent length range of 15 - 24 mm (Kehr and Basso 1990, Garda et al. 2007). Females are significantly larger than males, having snout-vent ranges of 16.2 - 24.8 mm, while the male snout-vent range is 15.3 â€“ 21.0 mm (Garda et al. 2010). The head is as wide as the body (Cope 1862). However, the head is small with large protruding eyes and a pointed snout (Garda and Cannatella 2007, Garda et al. 2010). There is no canthus rostrilis and the nostrils are vertical. The eye is twice the size of the tympanic disc (Cope 1862). It has relatively short forelimbs and long muscular hindlimbs (Garda and Cannatella 2007). All of the digits have a broad palmate appearance (Cope 1862). The humerus is shorter than the lower arm. The hands are short and not webbed (Goldberg and Fabrezi 2008). The base of the phalanges is thick. The smooth palms are not tubercular but have an acute cuneiforme tubercle at the base of finger I. Finger IV is longer than III (Cope 1862). Its hindlimbs have long, completely webbed feet well-suited for swimming (Goldberg and Fabrezi 2008). When appressed, the knee reaches the tympanum. The tibia is more than twice as long as the tarsus (Cope 1862). It has finely granulated skin on both the dorsal and ventral sides of its body (Garda and Cannatella 2007, Garda et al. 2010) except in the middle of the thorax. With the exception of the posterior surface of the tarsus, there are no dermal folds (Cope 1986).

Like most Lysapsus frogs, L. limellum exhibits a â€œparadoxicalâ€ life history, with its tadpoles being significantly larger than its adult frogs. Lysapsus limellum tadpoles can reach up to about 40 mm in total length (body and tail) and 11 mm in body length. Tadpoles have terminal oral discs directed forward. A large portion of the middle of the anterior labia lacks papillae, while the rest of the labia are fringed by one or two rows of papillae. The tadpoleâ€™s upper and lower jaws are serrated and 50% keratinized. Their tails are much longer than their body (Kehr and Basso 1990).

Lysapsus limellum is differentiated from L. laevis by the presence of small pointed tubercules on both the ventral and dorsal skin of the body, giving it granulated skin. Without the use of genetic sequencing, L. limellum is only differentiated from L. caraya by its habitat range: while L. limellum is found in the Amazon and ParanÃ¡ Basins, L. caraya is found in the Araguaia River basin. Lysapsus limellum can be distinguished from all frogs in the genus Pseudis by the presence of inner and outer metatarsal tubercles (small rounded nodules on the hindfoot) rather than only an inner metatarsal tubercle (Garda et al. 2010).

In life, L. limellum shows a variety of colors from pale green to a dark brown-green. While individual frogs may show patterns of spots or stripes, there is no species-specific pattern common to all L. limellum frogs (Garda et al. 2010). The eyes are golden (Kehr and Basso 1990).

Cope (1862) described the species, presumable in preservative, as having a dark reddish brown coloration with a dark spot on the back of the head. There were two sets of narrow yellowish lines along the side of the frog, one starting at the eye and the other starting at the tympanum. An additional light-colored line connected the corner of the mouth to the eye. There were broad transverse bands across the femur (2) and tibia (3). There was an additional broad brown band extending from the back of the knee to the cloacal region. The ventrum is rust colored and there are small brown spots on the lower labial area. 

The tadpoles are green in life and a greyish brown with spots in preservative. Tails in older tadpoles have a distinctive black tip, which may confuse predators and encourage them to attack the tail rather than the body (Kehr and Basso 1990).



","
Lysapsus limellum is found in the ParanÃ¡ River and Amazon River Basins, specifically in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay (Gallardo 1961) and Uruguay (Lavilla et al. 2004). It is typically pond-dwelling and widely distributed, with populations most often found in areas that are either near or in savannas or along large rivers (da Silva and Bates 2002). These areas all have high availability of water and low to no tree cover, prompting speculation that L. limellum prefers ponds in open floodplains. Within bodies of water, it is known to prefer areas of mostly open water, with floating vegetation rather than rooted aquatic vegetation. It is distributed across a wide area and so can be found at a wide range of altitudes, but is never found above 800 m above sea level (Garda et al. 2007).
","
Lysapsus limellum courts and breeds continuously throughout the year rather than having a breeding season (Prado and Uetanabaro 2000). Males sit atop floating vegetation while calling to females (HÃ¶dl 1977). They call during both the day and night, but are more active and call less during the day while at night they are stationary and call more. Males exhibit two known calls. The first, likely an advertisement call, is 0.12 to 0.34 seconds long and composed of 6 - 12 pulses between 3703 to 5599 Hz. The second is likely a social call, composed of two notes, which has been quantified in other species of Lysapsus but not in L. limellum (Santana et al. 2013). 

They lay clutches of 10 - 182 eggs (Garda et al. 2007).

The black tails tips in older tadpoles may confuse predators and encourage them to attack the tail rather than the body. Tadpoles live in midwater within ponds, staying within patches of aquatic vegetation. They are preyed upon by aquatic insects (Kehr and Basso 1990).

Lysapsus limellum is a generalist forager, feeding on dipterans, odonates, and mites. It is currently unknown whether it is an active, passive, or intermediate forager, or what time of the day most foraging occurs. As noted above it is most active during the day, and has been observed jumping on the water surface and then diving underwater to avoid threats. They are preyed upon by fish and large invertebrates (Garda et al. 2007). 

","

","
Because L. limellum is widely distributed and has large populations in the areas where it is found, it is not considered a threatened species (Prado and Uetanabaro 2000, Garda et al. 2010). Currently there are no known threats (Lavilla et al. 2004).

The species authority is: Cope, E. D. (1862). â€œOn some new and little known American Anura.â€ Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 14, 151â€“159.

Based on Parsimonious and Maximum Likelihood analyses along with Baysian Inference of 2377 base pairs of combined 12S and 16S rRNA, L. limellum is sister to L. caraya. The clade of consisting of L. limellum and L. caraya is sister to L. laevis. The genus Lysapsus as a whole is sister to Pseudis (excepting Pseudis minuta and P. cardosoi) (Garda and Cannatella 2007, Aguiar Jr. et al. 2007). Lysapsus and Pseudis make up the Pseudae group, a rankless clade within the family Hylidae (Garda and Canatella 2007).

Two subspecies of L. limellum, L. limellum limellum and L. limellum bolivianus sensu, were reported by Gallardo in 1961 and are generally accepted (Gallardo 1961, Garda and Cannatella 2007).

Lysapsus limellum is incorrectly referred to in some literature as Lysapsis limellus due to a mis-citation of the original species account from Cope (1862). It is also referred to in some literature as Pseudis limellum due to controversy over the phylogeny of the Pseudae group (Garda et al. 2007).

Cuban treefrogs are relatively large frogs in the family Hylidae. They have very large toe pads which are sometimes as large as their tympanum. There is no webbing between the toes on the front legs; however, the rear toes are slightly webbed. Their color is quite variable. They are usually gray to gray green but range to tan brown.   While these frogs have irises that are parallel to the ground when sitting, they do not have a stripe running through or below their eyes, as some tree frogs do. They have a distinct tarsal fold extending the full length of the tarsus. Juvenile Cuban tree frogs can be difficult to identify 
 (Duellman and Crombie 1970; Ashton and Ashton 1988; Carmichael and Williams 1991; Conant and Collins 1991). 
Tadpoles have a rounded body, and are black-colored on their dorsal side.  The fleshy part of the wide-finned tail is gray-brown, and the fin has scattered dark flecking on it  
(Ashton and Ashton 1988).  
 
 
 

","
This species is native to Cuba, the Isla de Pinos, the Bahamas Islands including Little Bahama Bank, Grand Bahama Bank, San Salvador, Rum, Crooked, and Acklins Islands, and the Cayman Islands including Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac (Duellman and Crombie 1970).  
 
This species has been introduced into a large part of southern Florida  
(Barbour 1913; Schwartz 1952; Allen and Neill 1953; King 1960; Duellman and Crombie 1970; Myers 1977; Wilson and Porras 1983; Smith and Kohler 1987; Conant and Collins 1991).  

","
This hylid frog usually breeds in temporary bodies of water.  Tadpoles have relatively fast growth rates and are usually able to metamorphose within weeks. Breeding males have horny nuptial excrescenses on their thumbs, and a medial internal subgular vocal sac with posterolateral extensions  
(Duellman and Crombie 1970). Females are much larger than males  
(Duellman and Schwartz 1958). Males are reported to mature at a small size, about 40 mm in length  
(Blair 1958). Females lay approximately 130 eggs  
(Duellman and Schwartz 1958; Ashton and Ashton 1988) per clutch. Eggs are deposited in lakes, ponds, drainage ditches, swimming pools, cisterns, etc  
(Behler 1979; Ashton and Ashton 1988). Duellman and Schwartz  
(1958) report eggs forming a thin floating sheet at the surface. This species is capable of using pools of relatively high salinity for reproduction  
(Duellman and Schwartz 1958; Ashton and Ashton 1988).  
 

","

","
Cuban treefrogs are apt predators. In areas where they have been introduced, they readily feed on smaller native frogs  
(Allen and Neill 1953; Carmichael and Williams 1991). These frogs should be handled with caution because they contain natural skin secretions that can cause skin irritation in humans  
(Carmichael and Williams 1991).

Osteopilus wilderi is a frog species, with snout-vent length that ranges from 24.2 to 29.2 mm in females and 24.3 to 27.9 mm in males (Schwartz and Fowler 1973).  The head is wider than long, with the width about a third of the snout-vent length (Lynn et al. 1940). The snout is rounded, with the upper jaw protruding further than the lower jaw. The tongue is rounded, notched and wide (up to two thirds as wide as the open mouth). There are two sets of short vomerine teeth, which do not extend to the choanae. There is a space between the two sets that is the length of one set. The nostrils are located at the end of the snout. The loreal region is slightly concave. The eye diameter is equal to the distance from the eye to the nostril, and the eyelids cover about half of the entire eyeball. The tympanum is one half the diameter of the eye. The distance from the tympanum to the eye is approximately the same as, if not equal to, the diameter of tympanum. The head is smooth and has a soft texture, with no bumps or ridges. The skull is co-ossified and has a casque. The belly texture is more granular. There is no dermal fold (Dunn 1925).

The fingers are unwebbed. The second finger is longer than the first and the fourth finger is longer than the second. The toes are partially webbed (webbing extends one third of the way up each toe, reaching the distal phalanx) except for the first toe, which is free. There are two metatarsal tubercles, with the inner one being larger (Lynn et al. 1940). Male nuptial pads are enlarged (Luna et al. 2018).

Tadpoles have flattened bodies, possibly as an adaptation to their microhabitat: they occur exclusively in bromeliads. Their mouth is very small and circular. There is a labial disk with the upper lip continuing in a circle without bends or notches and the lower lip not being notched. There may be bumps around the labial disk. There are no labial teeth (Grant 1940). 

Osteopilus wilderi is the smallest of the four Osteopilus species endemic to Jamaica. Osteopilus wilderi is often confused with the young of another Jamaican species, O. brunneas. Both species are also visually similar to O. dominicensis (from Hispaniola), and O. septentrionalis (in the greater Caribbean). Osteopilus wilderi differs from these three species by having a thumb pad, free skin on the head (not attached to the cranium), weak vomerine teeth, and less complete webbing between fingers and toes (Dunn 1925).

Osteopilus wilderi is also similar to two Haitian species, Boana heilprini and O. pulchrilineata. Both of the latter species also have unattached skin on the head, but they differ from O. wilderi in coloration (Dunn 1925).

The tadpoles of O. wilderi are small in comparison to the tadpoles of the three other Osteopilus species in Jamaica. Additionally, their tails are shorter than those of the other species on the island (Grant 1940). 

In life, O. wilderi may be light yellow green (most common) or reddish brown. The belly is mostly white, but the underside of the head, neck, and limbs are all pale green. Their interocular bar is distinct. The bar and their eyelids are metallic silvery to metallic yellow green. Their interocular bar is sometimes bordered by a brown stripe both above and below the bar, but it may also just be bordered by subtler brown spots (Schwartz and Fowler 1973). 

In preservative, O. wilderi are sage green with brown specks on the dorsal side of their body and limbs. The ventral side of the body and limbs is white. The pads of the hands and feet are white. The interocular bar is gray and bordered with brown. The bones of the limbs, specifically the tibia, can be seen through the skin (Lynn et al. 1940). 

There is some sexual dimorphism. Females lack a thumb pad (Dunn 1925), and the interocular bar is more common in females than males.  One study found that 41 of 54 females had the interocular bar, but only 4 of 43 males (Schwartz and Fowler 1973). Some data show that females are slightly larger than males, but other studies have concluded that there is no size sexual dimorphism in O. wilderi (Lynn et al. 1940).

Although most O. wilderi have homogeneously colored dorsal sides, some individuals may have silvery spots on their occiput and scapular regions. These spots may also be outlined with brown, similar to the outlining around the interocular bar (Schwartz and Fowler 1973).
","
Osteopilus wilderi is found only in central Jamaica. Its elevational range is between 120 and 880 m. It is found in closed canopy, tropical and subtropical lowland forests, where it resides in terrestrial and arboreal bromeliads. The species also can exist in secondary forests as long as there are bromeliads present (Hedges et al. 2004).

","
The species is rather rare and is typically found in terrestrial and arboreal bromeliads. They occupy smaller bromeliads in comparison to the four other Osteopilus species in Jamaica (Dunn 1926). 

Osteopilus wilderi displays the complex life cycle characteristic of metamorphosing frogs. Eggs are laid in small pools of water within bromeliads. When the tadpoles hatch, they rely on other eggs within the bromeliad as their main source of nutrients. It is theorized that the tadpoles may also eat other tadpoles living in the same bromeliad if undeveloped eggs donâ€™t provide sufficient food (Dunn 1926). 

Tadpoles of O. brunneus are known to prey on those of O. wilderi. Tadpoles of O. brunneus are typically found in large, tank bromeliads, which is one possible reason that eggs of O. wilderi are commonly laid in smaller bromeliads (Hedges 1987).

The diet of adult O. wilderi consists of small insectsâ€”mainly leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) (Moen and Wiens 2009).

Male frogs call at night from tree limbs where bromeliads sit. The throat is inflated during the call (Dunn 1925). The call of O. wilderi is a five-note call that follows the rhythm â€œticky-ticky-ticky-tick-tick.â€ The first tick is very fast and the last tick is most pronounced (Schwartz and Fowler 1973). 

","

","
Osteopilus wilderi is currently listed by the IUCN as â€œVulnerableâ€ (Hedges et al. 2004). Populations of O. wilderi are on the decline due to residential and commercial development, deforestation for wood harvesting, and deforestation for the creation of agricultural lands. Due to the habitat specificity of O. wilderi (females lay eggs only in bromeliads), deforestation and urbanization has decimated tree populations and, subsequently, the epiphytic bromeliad populations that live on these trees. Terrestrial bromeliad populations have also been affected by deforestation and urbanization (Hedges et al. 2004). 

On the eastern side of the island, O. wilderi occurs in one national park, the Blue and John Crow Mountain National Park, but stricter habitat protection laws and regulations are needed within this park (Hedges et al. 2004). Neither the Nature Conservancy nor Conservation International has yet to establish conservation models and monitoring systems for Jamaica in general (Hedges and Diaz 2011). 

","

","
Equally weighted Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses were conducted on the ribosomal 12S and 16S genes. Those analyses found that O. wilderi is sister to O. marianae (Blotto et al. 2020).

The genus name â€œOsteopilusâ€ means â€œbone cap,â€ referring to the co-ossification of dorsal portions of the casque skull with the overlying integument, which is characteristic of all members of the genus (Dodd 2013).

Osteopilus wilderi has also been called Hyla wilderi (Dunn 1925), Hyla shrevei (Taylor 1952), and Hyla wilderae (Duellman 1977). 

Osteopilus wilderi has been karyotyped; the diploid chromosome number (2N) equals 28 (Gruber et al. 2012).

In 2011, O. wilderi was one of only nine members of the family Hylidae (tree frogs) in the entire West Indies (Hedges and Diaz 2011).

Phasmahyla cochranae is a small leaf-frog; SVL varies from 28 mm to 37 mm in males and 41-46 mm in females. Snout outline rounded. Tympanum distinct below, hidden above, measuring 1/2 of the eye diameter. Eyes moderately large, directed foward. Pupils vertical. Supratympanic fold distinct only from posterior edge of tympanum to sholder. Vocal sac is subgular or absent. Nostrils at the tip of snouts, placed laterally and directed backward. Finger discs distinct. Fingers free, webbing absent. Finger subarticular tubercles moderately developed. Nuptial pad is present in males, on inner side of the first finger. Forearm fold distinct, glandular, not scalloped. Subarticular tubercles presents. General dorsal texture smooth-glandular; throat and chest weakly glandular; belly glandular. Toe discs distinct. Inner metatarsal tubercle ovoid; heel with small calcar.  Dorsal color pattern bright green, but can vary depending on the day time, to brown or redbrick, with scattered small white spots. Concealed surface of sides, arms, legs, finger and toes orange or yellowish with irregular rounded purple or red chocolate spots. 
This species shows some sexual size dimorphism, with males being lighter and smaller than females (Bokermann 1966; Heyer et al. 1990). Cruz (1990) described the cranial osteology of a closely related species, P. guttata. 

The tadpole was described by Bokermann (1966), Cruz (1982) and Heyer et al. (1990): LTRF 1/2(1) or 0/1(1). Total length 43 mm at Gosner stage 36. Body sub-cylindrical in dorsal view and triangular in lateral view. Snout broad in dorsal outline. Eyes dorsolateral, laterally directed. Nares dorsolateral, small and rounded. Spiracle ventral, with elliptical opening, directed posteriorly. Vent tube long and dextral, not fused with the fin. Tail slightly higher than body. Dorsal fin originates at the posterior third of the body. Dorsal and ventral fins arched.  Oral apparatus anteroventral, with a semicircular funnel-shaped dermal fold superiorly bilobed, showing two distinct sizes of papillae. Jaw sheaths moderately developed and finely serrated, upper jaw sheath V-shaped. Caudal muscle reaching tail tip. General coloration gray-brownish, fins transparent, with flecks (Altig and McDiarmid 1999).
","
Phasmahyla cochranae is found in Brazil, within eastern Minas Gerais, Southwestern Rio de Janeiro and eastern SÃ£o Paulo states.  It occurs along forest streams associated with the Atlantic Rainforest at elevations up to 800 m asl. 
","
Phasmahyla cochranae lives along riparian vegetation of forest streams (Ribeiro et al. 2005). It is commonly found at very low abundance, usually no more than 3 individuals in a chorus (Heyer et al. 1990), it occurs from October to April (Cardoso et al. 1989). The eggs are deposited in a gelatinous mass inside envelopes of folded leaves over swift streams; hatchling tadpoles drop into the currents and drift downstream to deeper and quieter pools along montane streams, where frequently they form schools near the water surface at night (Bokermann 1966; Haddad and Sazima 1992, reproductive mode 25 of Haddad and Prado 2005). The development takes about 5 months (Bertoluci 1997; Provete pers. obs.). The mean number of eggs in the clutch is 32, the general color is cream white (Bokermann 1966; Haddad 1991). 
Tadpoles of this species are neustonic and forage at the water surface (Altig and McDiarmid 1999). The tadpoles are found with highest abundance between September and December (Bertoluci 1997). During the day they take refuge under stones, logs and other debris (Bokermann 1966).

Its range is within protected areas, like the Parque Estadual Nova Baden, Parque Estadual de Ibitipoca, in the state of Minas Gerais, and Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina, Parque Municipal do Itapetinga, Serra do Japi and, EstaÃ§Ã£o BiolÃ³gica de BoracÃ©ia, in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, and in Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Decreasing according to IUCN (2008). 
","

","
The diploid number is equal to 26 (Duellman 1968). 
The genus is named in reference to the typical walking, resembling that of the insects of the order Phasmatodea (Cruz 1990). The specific epithet cochranae is in homage to Dr. Doris. M. Cochran (USNM) (Bokermann 1966). DÂ´heursel (2004) described the internal oral features of the larva of this species.

The only member of the genus Phyllomedusa to be completely terrestrial and overall dark brown in coloration. The genus Phyllomedusa is collectively known as the Leaf-frogs/monkey tree frogs due to their cataleptic movements as they move across trees. Duellman et al. (1988) express their surprise at finding a member of this genus to be terrestrial. A small species in which the male measures 37.4 mm and the female 44.6 SVL. This species differs from its congeners by the following characters: 1) dorsum brown with scattered metallic green flecks, 2) tympanum large (65-82% of eye diameter), 3) limbs short (tibia length 36-40% of SVL), 4) subarticular tubercles large, prominent, 5) phalanges and metatarsals (especially 4th toe) short and robust, 6) frontoparietals fused medially (no frontoparietal fontanelle visible dorsally), 7) palatines absent. Head tends to be large, slightly wider than body and lsightly longer than wide; 37.9-42.8% of  SVL. Pupils elliptical. Order of fingers from shortest to longest 2-1-4-3. Nuptial excrescences weakly developed in breeding males. Limbs relatively short, tibia length is 36.8-40.5% SVL.  
Skin smooth dorsally; ventral skin surfaces granular. Purplish-brown dorsal coloration both day and night with green metallic flecks scattered. Lacks characteristic flash coloration in inguinal region. Iris pale creamy bonze with minute black flecks, eye-shine red-orangeVocal slits in males extend from the posterolateral base of the tongue to corner of mouth, vocal sac single, medial, and subgular. Well developed parotoid glands are present in this species, although they are not visible externally. Sacrum and coccyx are fused and vomerine teeth are absent (variable characters within Phyllomedusine frogs). 
 
Tadpoles were collected at Orton Stage 27 (at 8 days): body length 7.5-9.0 mm, total length 22.5-25.5 mm. Spiracular tube short, flaplike, ventral, sinistral to midline opening at the center of the body. Snout is pale lime green and rest of body black wieth silvery blue belly and an elongate orange blotch on dorsal part of anterior half of dorsal fin.  

","
Known from only two localities which are separated by approximately 270 km. Cuzco Amazonico (a reserve) on the Rio Madre de Dios, and the Rio Manu in the Parque Nacional Manu. Both are of seasonally dry rainforest habitat. 
","
Individuals found during rainy season, individuals were found from 2230 and 0030 h on nights which were after overcast days with light rains of 20.0, 15.0, and 1.2 mm and temperatures of 18-32C. The majority of the captured specimens had been found on the wet leaf litter covered floor while one individual was found 10 cm above the ground on a stick. An amplectant pair was found while they were depositing eggs on a leaf above the ground at the edge of a shallow pool. Eggs of this species are enclosed in a leaf which the female wraps around the clutch. One clutch contains 20 unpigmented eggs 3 mm in diameter and many unembrionated capsules of clear jelly. Male calls are a soft ""wort"" lasting .2 s and a dominant frequency of 1150 Hz, and 180 pulses/s

P. ayeaye is a small Phyllomedusa (SVL 35-42.6 mm in males, 41.3-46.1 mm in females) (Lutz 1966; Caramaschi et al. 2006) belonging to the hypochondrialis group, with a green body and a reticulated pattern of red-orange blotches encircled by black or deep purple on the concealed surfaces of flanks and limbs.  The head occupies the first third of the body; the parotoid glands and vocal sac are indistinct; tympanum small; eyes with vertical pupils; vomerine teeth absent and choanae small. The arms are robust, with forearms slightly hypertrophied. Hands with slender fingers, not webbed or fringed, discs poorly developed, with finger I enlarged at the base and in opposition to the other fingers (nuptial pad of horny asperities evident in males, visible in dorsal view of finger I), subarticular and supernumerary tubercles single, large, round. The legs are short and robust; thigh length slightly longer than tibia length and both smaller than tarsus-foot length; calcar appendix and tarsal fold absent; metatarsal tubercles indistinct. Foot with slender toes, neither webbed nor fringed, and with globose apical discs, poorly developed. Toes I and II in opposition to the others; subarticular and supernumerary tubercles single, large, round. (Caramaschi et al. 2006). 

Some populations present regional particularities in the coloration pattern, such as a reticulate stripe in the upper lip, a reticulate pattern on the border of the eyelids, color of ventral surface slightly different (color ranging from whitish to light yellow) and color of the pattern ranging from gray, black to purple. For more details and drawings of some of these pattern variations see BaÃªta et al. (2010). 

The tadpole of P. ayeaye has an ovoid body, slightly wider than deep with a total length of about 44.3 Â± 2.0 mm at Gosner stage 37 (Pezutti et al. 2009). Eyes lateral, large. The spiracle is ventral, opening posteriorly, and the vent tube is dextral. Ventral fin beginning anterior to the vent tube and ending in a flagellum (Lutz 1966). The coloration of the body and tail is grayish-yellow with darker gray dots scattered on dorsal and ventral surface of the body and on tail musculature. Venter silver. In lateral view the dorsal portion of the peritoneum is dark bluish. Dorsal and ventral fins transparent with white and black spots scattered mainly on ventral fin. Labial tooth row formula 2(2)/3(1): A1 same length as A2; P3 smaller than P1 and P2 (Pezutti et al. 2009). The oral apparatus is surrounded by one row of marginal papillae as well as submarginal papillae (Cruz 1982). Jaw sheaths darkly pigmented and finely serrated on the margins, with the upper jaw sheath â€œMâ€ shaped and lower sheath â€œVâ€ shaped (Pezutti et al. 2009).

The original description of Phyllomedusa ayeaye (Lutz 1966) has some data on natural history of the species (perceptions from the authors about the vocalizations and movement of the species), since BaÃªta et al. (2009) synonymizes Phyllomedusa itacolomi (Caramaschi et al. 2006) with P. ayeaye, the description of P. itacolomi is a good source of information. Pezzuti et al. (2009) provide a good description of the tadpole of Phyllomedusa ayeaye (treated as P. itacolomi) that complements the original description by Lutz (1966) (which lacks drawings and comparisons with some species in the hypochondrialis group. Cruz (1982) provides the first drawing of the tadpole of P. ayeaye and interesting comparisons with other members of the genus.

","
Phyllomedusa ayeaye inhabits rivulets and deep pools in open formations in Southeastern Brazil. Its distribution is associated with â€œCampos Rupestresâ€along with Cerrado formation and its transition to the Atlantic Semi-deciduous Forest in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and in the Northern region of SÃ£o Paulo at 1600 m a.s.l. (AraÃºjo et al. 2007; BaÃªta et al. 2010). Giovanelli et al. (2008) provided an ecological niche modeling analysis, which predicted the geographical distribution of this species well beyond its current known distribution. New distribution data, which appeared in BaÃªta et al. (2010) agreed with that model. 
","
There is a lack of information on natural history of this species, but apparently the reproductive activity takes place from October to December (AraÃºjo et al. 2007) when males can be heard calling from bushes (0.5 to 2 m above water) in the marginal vegetation of temporary ponds and rivulets (Caramaschi et al. 2006). Newly metamorphosed individuals can be found in March (Drummond 2006). P. ayeaye reproduces by making leaf nests, which hang over pools in open areas, with dense vegetation inside (Cardoso et al. 1989; Caramaschi et al. 2006). Adults occur at low densities (BaÃªta et al. 2010; Giaretta and Oliveira 2007) and also at low frequencies (AraÃºjo et al. 2007). This species was found at only one out of 31 sites sampled by AraÃºjo et al. (2007). 
","

","
Its range is within protected areas in Brazil, such as the Parque Estadual das Furnas do Bom Jesus in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, and the Parque Estadual do Itacolomi, Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra, and Reserva Particular do PatrimÃ´nio Natural OvÃ­dio Pires, in the state of Minas Gerais. BaÃªta et al. (2010) and AraÃºjo et al. (2007) argue for the exclusion of P. ayeaye from both the Brazilian and the IUCN Red Lists of endangered species, based on new data about geographic distribution and abundance.

A medium size leaf-frog belonging to the P. hypochondrialis species group (31-44 mm SVL). Snout truncate in dorsal and lateral view. The space between the eyes is flat. The eyes are large and prominent, located antero-laterally; their diameter is equal to the length of the snout. The tympanum is little evident and rounded. Parotoid glands faintly developed, not entering the upper eyelid but bordering the tympanum. The vocal sac is not discernable. Fingers free, with weak roundish subarticular tubercles and with a large palmar tubercle. Short legs. Toes free, first toe opposable and larger than the second. A large, rounded inner metatarsal tubercle is present; the outer metatarsal tubercle is absent. A brown nuptial pad is present in males. Skin smooth, ventrally closely rugose, with larger granulations on the lower surface of thighs (Cei 1980; Caramaschi 2006). 

Dorsal color bright green, but can change to light brown by daytime; belly whitish, immaculate. A wide green stripe along the dorsal surface of thighs. Phyllomedusa azurea bears a narrow white stripe in the upper labium, which does not reach the edge of the lower eyelid. Wide red or orange bands with black transversal bars, regularly distributed on the anterior and posterior surface of the thighs, tibia, and tarsus (Cei 1980; Caramaschi 2006).

The tadpole of P. azurea has a slender, ovoid body, slightly wider than deep. Total length about 40 mm at Gosner stage 38. Eyes lateral, large. The spiracle is ventral, opening posteriorly. Vent tube dextral. Ventral fin curving in the posterior half of the tail and with a very acuminate tip. The enlarged portion of the ventral fin is finely marbled with small dark spots. Labial tooth row formula 2(2)/2(1). The oral apparatus is surrounded by one row of marginal papillae as well as submarginal papillae. The upper jaw sheath is broad and finely serrated (Cei 1980). Budgett (1899) meticulously described the early development of the embryo and tadpoles of P. azurea (treated as P. hypochondrialis) from Paraguayan chaco.  
","
Its distribution includes the Chacoan regions of eastern Bolivia (Beni and Santa Cruz Provinces), northern Argentina (Salta, eastern Jujuy, Formosa, Chaco, northern Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe and Corrientes Provinces) and Paraguay from the lowlands up to 1,500 m. In Brazil, this species has been recorded in the Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) and Pantanal regions, in the states of southwestern Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, southern Tocantins, GoiÃ¡s, Distrito Federal, eastern Minas Gerais and lately in the northwestern region of SÃ£o Paulo State (Cei 1980; Caramaschi 2006; Frost 2007; Prado et al. 2008). 

Phyllomedusa azurea inhabits open formations in South America, usually in the seasonally flooded grasslands and open habitats in tropical dry forests.
","
Phyllomedusa azurea is only active at night (Budgett 1899). Cei (1980) reports this species (treated as P. hypochondrialis azurea) living in the axillary sheets of bromeliads in northern Argentina; this was also noted by Budgett (1899) in the Paraguayan chaco. 

The reproductive activity takes place during the rainy season (from December to February, according to Budgett 1899; from October to May, according to Rodrigues et al. 2007). Prado et al. (2008) found two calling males standing upon herbaceous vegetation at the edge of a shallow farm pond in a pastureland near a forest fragment, in the northwestern region of the SÃ¯Â¿Â½o Paulo State, Brazil. The advertisement call can be heard on Toledo et al. (2008).  Adults reproduce in temporary ponds, with dense vegetation inside (Laurent 1973; Cei 1980; Prado et al. 2005; Rodrigues et al. 2007). Like other members of the species group, P. azurea builds leaf nests in herbaceous plants, which hang over temporary ponds in open areas (Prado et al. 2005; Rodrigues et al. 2007). Budgett (1899) reported that a nest found by him at about 1 m above the water contained about 100 eggs (see also Rodrigues et al. 2007), and that the egg laying process lasted 45 minutes. 

The abundance peak recorded by Rodrigues et al. (2007) occurred in December, when about 25 individuals were found in their study site, composed of a temporary pond and a flooded field. 
  


","

","
Its range is within protected areas in Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia.  A possible threat may be the increasing habitat modification due to the culture of sugarcane and soybean in Central Brazil, and also the building the dams. Phyllomedusa azurea seems to adapt well to habitat change and is able to live in secondary forest. This species has also been reported to occur in urban areas, in Bolivia (IUCN 2006). However, a more complete assessment of its distribution and ecological requirements is needed to correctly assign the conservation status of this recently revalidated species.  
","
There are reports of P. hypochondrialis being collected for the pet trade. Since P. azurea was until recently confounded with the former taxon, it is likely that P. azurea has also been used as a pet. Phyllomedusa azurea has been recorded in urban areas in Bolivia (IUCN 2006).

Phyllomedusa bicolor is a large, arboreal frog (Boulenger 1882; Lima et al. 2005; Mota et al. 2020). Females range from 111 - 119 mm in snout-vent length, while males range from 91 - 113 mm (Lima et al. 2005; VenÃ¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010). A truncated snout can be observed in addition to an oblique loreal region. The diameter of the eye is shorter than the snout and bigger than the tympanum. The interorbital space is greater than the upper eyelid (Boulenger 1882).  There is a distinct parotoid gland observable from behind the eye and over the tympanum (Boulenger 1882; Lacombe et al. 2000; Lima et al. 2005). Skin covers the tympanic membrane (Wagler 1830). 

The fingers are free, and the second and third are larger than the first and fourth respectively; the disks of the fingers are flat and similar in size to the tympanum (Wagler 1830; Boulenger 1882). An inner metatarsal tubercle is faint. When the hind limb is adpressed along the body, the tibio-tarsal articulation reaches the shoulder or tympanum. The toes are also free, with the first and second being equal in length, and with smaller disks than the fingers (Boulenger 1882). 

Bony deposits stud the upper surface of P. bicolor and granulations that are visible ventrally and at the lower surface of the thighs (Boulenger 1882). Lipid glands appear in the dorsal and dorsolateral regions, mucous glands appear in ventral surface skin, and serous glands appear all over the body (Lacombe et al. 2000).

Pinto et al. (2013) determined that metamorphosed froglets at Stage 46 have a snout-vent ranging from 21.34 - 22.81 mm. 

Phyllomedusa bicolor can be differentiated from other species by coloration. Specifically P. bicolor has dark gray irises and purplish/brown fingers with blue/green discs, while P. tarsius has red-orange irises with black reticulations and white-tipped, brown first and second fingers. Such coloration also contrasts to P. vaillanti, which has silvery-gray irises and orange or dark purple discs on the fingers. Furthermore, P. bicolor has blue-green bellies and purple-edged, white spots on their sides, while P. vaillanti has purple bellies and sides (Lima et al. 2005).

It is unclear whether the following coloration description is in life or preservative. The dorsum of  P. bicolor is blue-green, while the ventrum ranges from purplish-white, cream, or yellow-white. Small, purple-edged, white spots are visible laterally along the body and limbs, more dense on the flank and hind legs. Similar spots are also on the chest and lower lips. A narrow line of similar coloration to such spots runs along the outer side of the forearms and tarsus. The fingers themselves are either purplish or brown with blue or green discs. Phyllomedusa bicolor also has dark gray irises (Boulenger 1882; Lima et al. 2005). 

At the froglet stage, froglets are green, with sparse, darkly-outlined, and white spots on the chest and hind legs (Pinto et al. 2013).

Regarding size, males are generally smaller than females (Lima et al. 2005; VenÃ¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010).
","
Phyllomedusa bicolor is endemic to the Amazon Basin of Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Columbia, the Guianan Region of Venezuela and the Guianas, extreme eastern Panama, and the Cerrado of MaranhÃ£o, Brazil (Duellman et al. 2016; VenÃ¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010). Such regions range from 0 - 900 m in elevation, encompassing freshwater wetlands and forests that can receive annual precipitation of 1900 to 2300 mm and warm to hot temperatures. Dry seasons can last from June to October while wet seasons from November to May (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004; Lima et al. 2005; IUCN 2010).
","
This species is nocturnal and arboreal (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004). 

The frogs can jump, but have been described by Caramaschi and Cruz (2002) to walk slowly on foliage to search for resting places or food, with their bright colors hidden during movement, and aposematically displayed at rest. 

Males call from high trees (ranging from 1 - 8 m) and vocalize around 19:00 hours, exhibiting fighting behavior over females (VenÃ¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010). Phyllomedusa bicolor displays breeding site fidelity, as well as low dispersal and movement patterns (Mota et al. 2020). 

Phyllomedusa bicolor possesses three dermal glands: mucous, lipid, and serous glands.  The mucous and lipid glands of P. bicolor produce cutaneous secretions for skin homeostasis. Serous glands, meanwhile, produce granules, which start small and fuse into larger granules, meant to store and eventually discharge venom; serous glands are the only integumental glands that contain the peptide I-13, which indicates the presence of biologically active and mature peptides (Barberio et al. 1987; Lacombe et al. 2000). Lacombe et al. (2000) and VenÃ¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio (2010) both hypothesize that the biologically active peptides produced on the skin of P. bicolor, in addition to a large body size, aid in defense against predators.

Phyllomedusa bicolor follow Haddad and Pradoâ€™s reproductive Mode 24 (2005), where eggs hatch as exotrophic tadpoles that fall into still freshwater. A jelly-like mass of eggs with a mean of 859.5 eggs per clutch, is laid by females in leaf nests hanging over water. These nests are created by males roughly folding/joining 2 or 3 leaves and range from 1.4 - 2.8 m above the water (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004; Lima et al. 2005; Mota et al. 2020). Phyllomedusa bicolor has the largest clutch size of the Amazonian arboreal anuran nesters. As anuran eggs are a high-protein energy source,  P. bicolor clutches have predators of staphylinid beetles, phorid flies, and mammals; due to the large size of the eggs, P. bicolor  egg predation by mammals is unique when compared to P. tarsius and P. tomopterna (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004). 
","
Phyllomedusa bicolor has exotrophic larvae that inhabit non-flowing systems of water. As suspension-raspers, they partially feed through rasping submerged surfaces or filtering suspended particles from water columns (McDiarmid and Altig 1999). 

Described at Stage 36 by Pinto et al. (2013), but with information on Stages 24 - 40 available in the text, the total length of the larvae is between 41.32 - 46.17 mm, with the body roughly 40% of that length and the tail roughly 60%. From a lateral view, the body is triangular, and from a dorsal view, the body is elongated. The snout is truncated both laterally and dorsally. The nostrils are small and ovoid, positioned anterolaterally near the snout, with an internarial distance ~30% greater than eye diameter. The larvae have large eyes (a diameter of 2.28 - 2.46 mm), which are laterally positioned and directed. The interorbital distance is ~70% greater than eye diameter. The oral disc, with a width ranging from 4.00 - 4.50 mm, is anteriorly directed and ventrally emarginated. The marginal papillae is uniseriate and elongate, leaving a wide gap on the anterior labium, which is roughly two-thirds of the first anterior labial tooth row. Smaller, submarginal papillae are laterally present on the posterior and anterior labium. The labial tooth row formula is 2(2)/3(1). Anterior rows 1 and 2 are of similar length, while the second posterior row is shorter than the first posterior row, but double the length of the third posterior row. The second anterior row has a wide gap, while first posterior row has a small gap. Additionally, on the first posterior row, there are around 45 labial teeth per millimeter. The upper and lower jaw sheaths are wide with small, triangular-shaped, fine serrations. However, the upper jaw sheath is M-shaped, while lower is V-shaped. On the lower jaw sheath, there are around 27 serrations per millimeter (Pinto et al. 2013).

A posteriorly directed, singular spiracle is nearly ventral and has an absent inner wall. The spiracular opening is large, not visible dorsally, and located below the middle of the body. Attached to the right side of the ventral fin is the larvaeâ€™s short vent tube. The ventral fin itself is slightly arched, coming from the body terminus and consistent in height for two-thirds of its anterior, until it gradually tapers to the tip. The dorsal fin originates from the tail-body junction, featuring a unique cord (thickening on the edge of the fin) that is present throughout all stages. The upper fin is generally shallow, but is at its highest point toward the posterior, and extends nearly to the end of the tail. The caudal musculature is broader than the dorsal fin and gradually tapers to a pointed tip. Maximum tail height ranges from 8.00 - 9.44 mm, which is roughly double the maximum height of the tail musculature (Pinto et al. 2013).

In life, the tadpoles have orange dorsums and anterior parts of their body, in addition to a silver belly. The tail musculature and the dorsal finâ€™s unique cord is a paler orange, and the fins are a translucent orange. Their irises are also silver. In preservation, the light yellow body has a brownish gray dorsum, gray lateral side, and gray belly. The tail musculature and the dorsal finâ€™s unique cord is pale brown, while the casual musculatureâ€™s dorsal surface is brown. Their fins are translucent as well. Through the skin, intestines cannot be observed (Pinto et al. 2013).

From Stages 24 to 40, the larvae undergo changes in labial tooth row formula, vent tube distinction, and skin texture. The labial tooth row formula at Stage 24 is 1(1)/2(1) and 2(2)/3(1) or 2(2)/3(1-2) at Stages 26, 27, 29, and 34. After Stage 24, two anterior tooth rows and three posterior tooth rows stabilize, with posterior gaps only varying at advanced developmental stages. From early developmental stages (Stages 24 - 25), the vent tube is indistinct and the larvae are more slender, less pigmented, and lighter in tail musculature. From Stages 36, 37, 38, and 40, the lateral surfaces develop a grainy texture from the postorbital region to body terminus, with such a texture scarce ventrally (Pinto et al. 2013).

Phyllomedusa bicolor larvae, when compared to other Phyllomedusa larvae, similarly feature triangular bodies with anteroventral mouths and small nostrils near their snout. The larvae also have heavy caudal musculature, ventral fins deeper than the shallow dorsal fin, and a sinistral, nearly ventral spiracle. But, the tadpoles of P. bicolor are distinguishable from all closely related species, except P. vaillanti through their dorsal finâ€™s unique cord, which is visible at all stages. Phyllomedusa bicolor larvae can also be distinguished from P. bahiana larvae by their smaller size, papillae disposition, and coloration in life (where P. bahiana has marginal and sub-marginal papillae regularly and laterally positioned in double rows, and dorsolaterally on portions of the oral disc, a pale beige body and tail musculature, and very dark brown punctuations, giving a dark appearance, on the dorsal and lateral surfaces). A smaller size and coloration distinguish P. bicolor from Phyllomedusa boliviana, P. tomopterna, P. trinitatis, and P. tetraploidea (where, in life, P. boliviana has gold and black pigments with a transparent dorsum, a transparent belly, and gold lateral surfaces, P. tomopterna has a transparent whitish olive body, silver/yellow/yellowish tan abdomen, whitish/transparent tail with a diffuse orange patch in the middle of the lower fin, P. trinitatis has a distinct cluster of black spots on the ventral fin, which expand to form a black bar across the tail, and P. tetraploidea (unclear if in life) has a rectangular dark spot between its eyes). Phyllomedusa bicolor is differentiated from P. camba by their smaller size, depth of fins, labial tooth row formula, and coloration in life (where P. camba has ventral and dorsal fins of similar depth, a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3, dorsally black bodies that become dark bluish gray ventrally). Furthermore, P. bicolor is differentiated from P. vaillanti by their smaller size, labial tooth row formula, size of labial tooth row, and coloration in life (where P. vaillanti has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3 or 2(2)/3(1) with posterior 2 slightly greater than posterior 3, a black spot between the eyes, a gray-greenish body and tail and whitish belly in eastern Brazilian Amazon, and a dull green dorsum, pale green musculature, and white belly in Peru) (Pinto et al. 2013). Larger size, vent tube size and position, and coloration in life separates P. bicolor from P. atelopoides (where P. atelopoides has a longer vent tube that is sinistral to the ventral fin, a black brownish body, silvery blue belly, and pale lime green snout). Phyllomedusa bicolor larvae have a larger size, distribution of submarginal papillae, and coloration when compared to P. iheringi (where P. iheringi does not have submarginal papillae, but does feature four dark spots and a trapezoidal blotch on its head). The size of their labial tooth row distinguishes P. bicolor from P. burmeisteri and P. distincta (where in both species the second posterior tooth row is more than double the length of third posterior). Labial tooth row formula and distribution of marginal papillae separates P. bicolor from P. hypochondrialis (where P. hypochondrialis, in Venezuela, has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3 and a gap in the marginal papillae of its posterior labium). In addition, P. bicolor is separated from P. palliata by their labial tooth row formula and coloration in life (where P. palliata has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3 and bluish gray body and tail with a iridescent bluish green sheen on its belly). Only coloration in life distinguishes P. bicolor from P. tarsius (where P. tarsius  has a transparent olive/whitish body and a silver/pale metallic green belly). Lastly, P. bicolor is differentiated from P. venusta by the size of papillae gap (where P. venusta has a gap between papillae that is roughly one-third of the first anterior row) (Pinto et al. 2013).

Regarding development, Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski (2004) observed that embryonic development was quick, lasting 10.9 - 12.1 days, before the larvae hatch with external gills, falling into the water below, and developing into aquatic tadpoles. 

The development of the mucous, serous, and lipid glands were also observed by Lacombe et al. (2000) on the P. bicolor tadpole skin. The three glands appear as small granular structures in pigmented layers that are distinct on the dorsal skin. The structures, particularly the serous glands, develop into larger acini later. The lipid glands develop later during ontogenesis (Lacombe et al. 2000).
","
Phyllomedusa bicolor is threatened by logging and wood harvesting, but conservation sites have been established in the speciesâ€™ distribution (IUCN 2010).
","
The secretions of P. bicolor are commonly referred to as Sapo or KambÃ´ and utilized in hunting rituals by indigenous people from the Southwestern Amazon basin, in particular Brazilians and the Matses Indians of Peru, (Erspamer et al. 1993; Aquila et al. 2017; Vega et al. 2020; MajiÄ‡ et al. 2021). The secretion is meant as a remedy to panema (bad luck in hunting) by improving luck and strength, in addition to simply being used for salutogenic or detoxification purposes (Aquila et al. 2017; MajiÄ‡ et al. 2021). To collect such secretions, P. bicolor is usually caught and kept for three days; its back and limbs are gently and periodically scraped with a stick, which is placed in a leaf bag over a fire, then used again to keep scrapping. After three days, the frog is respectfully released and the stick is covered in a yellow substance, which is mixed with saliva to be used and applied to intentionally burned wounds (Erspamer et al. 1993; Aquila et al. 2017). KambÃ´ has gained popularity in alternative therapy clinics by Western users (Mota et al. 2020; MajiÄ‡ et al. 2021). Phyllomedusa bicolorâ€™s secretion itself contains up to 16 bioactive peptides which can function as opioids, vasoactive molecules, antimicrobials, antiprotozoals, or Î¼-opioid receptors with analgesic properties (Aquila et al. 2017; Vega et al. 2020; MajiÄ‡ et al. 2021). These biopeptides potentially affect the cardiovascular system of users, causing intense cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms (ranging from vomiting, hot flashes, diarrhea, racing heart, nausea, sweating, etc.) and mild psychoactive effects, as provided by anecdotal observations (notably a feeling that the spirit of the frog is with them) (Erspamer et al. 1993; MajiÄ‡ et al. 2021). Hypotheses suggest that ceruletide and sauvagine may cause central effects, while ceruletide, phyllokinin, phyllomedusin, sauvagine and opioid peptides cause peripheral effects (MajiÄ‡ et al. 2021). MajiÄ‡ et al. (2021) believe that more research is indeed to investigate the effects of the secretion and determine any possible health concerns.

Two studies, one utilizing four mitochondrial genes and five nuclear genes (Faivovich et al. 2005) and another utilizing four mitochondrial genes and three nuclear genes (Wiens et al. 2006) determined that the Phyllomedusa genus is monophyletic. This was later supported by Duellman et al. (2016) through analysis of two mitochondrial genes and ten addition nuclear loci. Faivovich et al. (2005), further found that P. bicolor and P. vallanti are sister taxa, which is supported by the fact that both feature osteoderms (dermal ossifications) that protrude beyond the skin (Ruibal and Shoemaker 1984; Faivovich et al. 2010). However, as Faivovich et al. (2005), Wiens et al. (2006), and Duellman et al. (2016) were more broad scale analyses, it is unclear which species is unequivocally the most closely related to P. bicolor.  

Mota et al. (2020), on the other hand, used nucleotide sequences for the genes 16S, Cytb, and RAG-1 to determine that P. bicolor likely has two cryptically divergent lineages corresponding to a geographic division in the eastern and western regions of Amazonia, in addition to the Amazonâ€™s well-defined climate gradient. The eastern Amazonia likely is compromised of populations in the Guiana Shield and the Brazilian Shield.

The name of the genus Phyllomedusa is derived from the Greek, â€œphylloâ€, which means â€œleaf/foliage,â€ and â€œmedousa,â€ which means â€œqueen/protector.â€ Therefore, Phyllomedusa means â€œqueen/protector of the foliageâ€ and alludes to the green color and large size of members of the genus (Caramaschi and Cruz 2002). 

Boddaert (1772) originally named Phyllomedusa bicolor as Rana bicolor until Wagler (1830) proposed the species be placed in Phyllomedusa (Caramaschi and Cruz 2002).

In analysis of the ultrastructure sperm of P. bicolor, as compared to P. hypochondrialis and P. tarsius, P. bicolor was determined to have similar structures to P. tarsius. Relative to P. hypochondrialis, both species had a large spermatozoon with a reduced nuclear space, an abruptly ending anterior region in the nucleus, and a larger axial fibre; the subacrosomal cones, which fill the space between the acrosome vesicle and nucleus, are also transversely less electron-dense and more granular (Costa et al. 2005).

Phyllomedusa palliata is a frog that most closely resembles P. hypochondrialis and P. rohdei in size and structure.  From above, the snout is rounded. In males, the snout is truncate from below. In females, the snout is slightly inclined anteroventrally. Snout-vent lengths range from 37.7 - 43.8 mm in males and 38.8 - 49.1mm in females. The parotoid glands are low and rounded, extending to the scapula. The first finger is opposable and shorter to the second. In contrast, the first toe is opposable and much longer than the second. The discs on fingers and toes are small. The forearm is slender. Dorsal skin is smooth (Duellman 1974).

P. palliata can be differentiated from P. hypochondrialis and P. rohdeli, and from most other species of Phyllomedusa, by its pale coloration below the nostrils and eye, flanks with brown flecks, irregular dashes on the posterior surfaces of the thighs, and cream and brown flecks through its venter (Duellman 1974).

In life, the dorsal surfaces and side of head above the nostrils and the middle of orbit are dark green. The side of head, below the nostrils and the middle of orbit, and flanks are cream or tan with scattered brown flecks. The iris is bronze with black reticulations. In the groin area, irregular brown dashes are scattered about the orange coloration. The anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs are colored like the groin. The ventral surfaces are cream color with brown flecks throughout (Duellman 1974). 

","
Phyllomedusa palliata is found in Upper Amazon Basin in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil (Duellman 1974; Angulo et al. 2004; Segalla et al. 2012).

In Southeastern Peru, individuals of P. palliata have been found at night in terra firme forest, floodplain forest, and palm swamps (von May et al. 2010). 
","
Phyllomedusa palliata breeds in temporary pools formed in lowland forests. Females deposit eggs on the upper surface of leaves, on plants growing at the edge of pools and in areas that become inundated (Duellman 1978).
","

","

","

","
In 1871, Peters originally reported a P. palliata specimen as P. hypochondrialis, but later noted that the specimen actually represented a new species, which he named Phyllomedusa palliata. 

P. palliata was incorrectly identified as synonymous with Phyllomedusa tomopterna by Funkhouser in 1957, but more careful inspection showed many differences  (Duellman 1974).

The snout-vent length for Phyllomedusa sauvagii ranges from 69.0 - 89.2 mm for males and between 83.4 - 96.6 mm for females. The head of the frog is longer than it is wide, and shaped like a trapezoid from both the dorsal and lateral view. This makes a broad, angular head that is not as wide as the body. The snout itself is truncated (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). The teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla both have circular tips. Phyllomedusa sauvagii possesses vertically elliptical pupils in relatively protruding eyes (Kok and Kalamandeen 2008). This anuran has well-developed, protruding parotoid glands (De La Riva 1999). A singular, subgular, and non-distinct vocal sac, as well as vocal slits are present (Duellman 2010; Kok and Kalamandeen 2008). The tympanum is visible on the sides of the head (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). The skin of P. sauvagii exhibits distinct wrinkles (De La Riva 1999). Phyllomedusa sauvagii has long, thin limbs, reduced terminal discs in the phalanges, lacks toe webbing, and has opposable thumbs used to grip trees (Wells 2007; Sheil and Alamillo 2005). 

Larvae measure around 6.7 mm at stage 24. At this stage gills are still present, but have an opercular fold covering the base.  Gill ciliation is also still present. The tail is relatively long, measuring around 0.7 mm, with high fins and narrows to a thin flagellum. The defining features of the mouth are the presence of two marginal papillae and serrated jaw sheaths in the oral disc. Keratodonts and amedical spiracle arenâ€™t seen in the larvae until stage 25 of development (Salica et al. 2011).

The skull of Phyllomedusa sauvagii resembles that of P. vaillantii and P. venusta, with less resemblance seen in P. atelopoides (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). Unlike the P. tarsius  group, P. sauvagii does not have black reticulations in the iris (De La Riva 1999). The truncated snout is distinct from that of other related species, such as P. vaillanti, which have round snouts (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). The body of P. sauvagii is larger, more robust and round than P. boliviana and P. burmeisteri, which are especially slender and angular (Rodrigues et al. 2007). 

 In life, the body of P. sauvagii ranges from light-brownish to bright green with a very distinctive opaque overlayer from their natural waxy coating (De La Riva 1999). In preservative, its skin turns to a deep purple (Kok and Kalamandeen 2008). Most frogs have distinctive white ventral stripes, varying in continuity, distinctiveness and placement. Most frogs also have a variable white striped marking along the bottom mandible that extends down the length of the body. In addition, some individuals may have orange and black coloration on the bottom sides of their limbs that vary in continuity and placement. Their eyes are a pale gray color (De La Riva 1999).

 Sexual dimorphism is present in P. sauvagii. The snouts of females are rounder than males (Rodrigues et al. 2007). Females are larger than males and the mass of the gonads make up a higher percentage of the femaleâ€™s body mass (Rodrigues et al. 2007). In addition, the maxillae are bent in the females and straighter in males (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016).

","
Phyllomedusa sauvagii can be found in South American rainforests and humid montane forests, specifically in the Chacoan region of eastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, Mato Grosso do Sul of central Brazil, and Northern Argentina (Duellman 2010; Aquino et al. 2004). The species can be found up to 1500 meters above sea level (Aquino et al. 2004).
","
Phyllomedusa sauvagii is an arboreal breeder that, during mating season, lives near temporary lagoons and flooded fields and has adapted to living in areas with dry seasons (Aquino et al. 2004, Rodrigues et al. 2007). During the dry period, individuals can be found â€œin small forest fragments near to pondsâ€ (Rodrigues et al. 2007). 

In accordance with its nocturnal lifestyle, the frog calls at night, usually around two hours after sunset (Rodrigues et al. 2007). During the rainy seasons, the male P. sauvagii will call nearly every night. This occurs when heavy rainfall over several days fills nearby ponds (Schaulk et al. 2016). In addition, Halloy and Espinoza (2000) found that all P. sauvagii males will fight over some calling sites, but did not determine if it is specifically for oviposition sites or calling sites (Wells 2007). Corresponding with calling, reproduction occurs in the rainy season, from October to May (Rodrigues et al. 2007). Phylomedusa sauvagii has characteristics of both an explosive breeder and a prolonged breeder in that there is a concentration of males calling after rain, but the reproductive period lasts longer than 6 months (Rodrigues et al. 2007). After vocalizing on shrubs during heavy rainy days (and up to 2 days after), a mating pair will go to a pond or a flooded field and into the vegetation (Wells 2007, Rodrigues et al. 2007). The males do not seem to actively search for females, and the females do not exhibit polyandry (Rodrigues et al. 2007). 

Like many of the Phyllomedusa genus,  P. sauvagii  lays terrestrial clutches in nests made out of leaves (Wells 2007). In axillary amplexus, the parents use their body weight and movement of their legs to fold up one to three leaves of the Asteraceae family, into which they deposit their clutches. The pair places their nest above water (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Garcia et al. 2013). Amongst the eggs, there are gelatinous eggless capsules, which, along with the folded leaf nests, decrease chances of desiccation (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Wells 2007). Additionally, because of the non-aquatic egg phase, females choose microhabitats specifically to reduce desiccation (Garcia et al. 2013). 

Eggs are relatively large (2.54 mm is the average) and highly yokey, with a range of 201 to 829 eggs per clutch (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Salica et al. 2011). Phyllomedusa sauvagii has indirect development and ontogeny. Complete embryonic development lasts around seven days (Salica et al. 2011). Larvae feed on the yolk in the egg until they hatch (Rodrigues et al. 2007). Once they hatch, tadpoles fall from their leaf nests down into the water (Garcia et al. 2013). Gill regression begins once the tadpoles enter the water, occasionally fully regressing within two hours (Salica et al. 2011). 

Since  P. sauvagii  lives in a habitat that has a limited and unpredictable amount of water, the adults exhibit uricotelism. Additionally, P. sauvagii larvae exhibit ureotelism, despite the fact that they are aquatic. This means that they secrete urea, and only start excreting uric acid during metamorphosis (Hellman et al. 2009).

In females, there is a positive correlation between snout-vent length and ovary mass, as well as body and ovary mass. However, the number of mature eggs has no correlation with either body mass or snout-vent length. Females also have no correlation between snout-vent length and reproductive energy. However, there is a  negative correlation between reproductive output and body mass.  In males, there are no major correlations between snout-vent length and reproductive energy, and no correlation between body mass and reproductive energy (Rodrigues et al. 2007).

Generally, arboreal frogs have lower evaporative water loss than non-arboreal frogs. We see even lower evaporative water loss in Phyllomedusa (Shoemaker et al. 1975; Faivovich et al. 2010). Phyllomedusa sauvagii achieves these low rates through waxy skin secretions that are produced by skin lipid glands and spread over the body through movement of the hind limbs and rear in a motion referred to as â€œwiping behaviorâ€ of which there are four variations (Blaylock et al. 1976; Gomez et al. 2006). The waxy secretion is a mix of wax esters and triglycerides, with free fatty acids and hydrocarbons that block water evaporation up to 38 to 39 degrees Celsius (McClanahan et al. 1978; Hillman et al. 2009). This waxy secretion, along with the excretion of uric acid (up 80% of the nitrogen waste), and diurnal torpor, allows for impermeabilization of the skin (Castanho et al. 2001). Due to its waterproof skin, the frog can bask in the sunlight and raise its body temperature from 35 to 40 degrees Celsius. When dehydrated, P. sauvagii will increase their body temperature, supposedly for water conservation. To prevent overheating, they use a mucous gland discharge. Phyllomedusa in general can use their serous skin glands to modulate secretions, similar to sweating in other animals (Hillman et al. 2009).

 When not sitting on small branches with its legs tucked in, P. sauvagii moves by walking instead of hopping (Wells 2007; Soliz and Ponssa 2016). Due to this walking gait and its opposable digits, the frog has a lemuroid manner of climbing (Duellman 2010). The genus Phyllomedusa is adapted to an arboreal lifestyle, specifically in the forelimb. The forelimb has an â€œelongation and increase in size of the muscles, the presence of strong and long tendons, â€¦ and the presence of elongated and naked bony areasâ€ (Manzano et al. 2008). Muscles have accessory branches, and there is a greater abduction of the fifth digit, which all allow for a better grip. Interestingly, P. sauvagii can utilize a precision grip on narrow branches and in its wiping behavior; precision grip is only seen elsewhere in higher primates (Manzano et al. 2008).

The small, narrow leaves of Asteraceae can expose the eggs, so when egg predation is evident, it seems that the eggs are wrapped in more leaves. Adult anurans also see predation from birds and crocodiles (Rodrigues et al. 2007).

While the diet of P. sauvagii remains unclear, assumptions can be made based on closely related species. Most anurans eat terrestrial invertebrates. The frogâ€™s sister taxon, the P. burmeisteri group, regularly eats arthropods (de Paula Lima et al. 2010). Pyllomedusa sauvagii practices dermatophagy, which means that they ingest stratum corneum after molting. This provides a supplementary source of vitamin D and proteins (Castanho et al. 2001). During rain, P. sauvagii drinks rain drops that drip from the leaves of its habitat by lifting its snout in the air to pump water down its throat, allowing the frog to obtain water without leaving its primary habitat (Wells 2007; Hillman et al. 2009).




","

","
This species currently has a stable population trend and has an IUCN Red Listing status of ""Least Concern"". However, P. sauvagii is threatened by the international pet trade, habitat destruction, pollution, and fires (Aquino et al. 2004). In the CÃ³rdoba, Argentina part of the Chacoan forest, forest degradation from logging and overgrazing has simplified diversity and structure. This changes the frogâ€™s ability to find proper vegetation for reproduction (Garcia et al. 2013). 

Larval development is also affected by arboreal habitat partially converted for agriculture or lost completely (Rodrigues et al. 2007). In addition, the rate of gametogenesis in the frog has been observed to decline in times of high heat and drought (Wells 2007). 

While there are no specific conservation efforts for P. sauvagii, the frog occurs in several protected areas (Aquino et al. 2004). Within the Chacoan forest specifically, there are many protected areas, including the Bolivian Chaco, with indigenous people co-managing a large area of land (Arambiza and Painter 2006).

","
These frogs are part of the international pet trade but are not protected under the CITES Treaty Act. Of the 33,000 amphibians recorded in the Hong Kong pet trade between 1 December 2005 and 30 November 2006, five were found to be  P. sauvagii (Rowley et al. 2007). 

In addition to the pet trade, P. sauvagii skin toxins are being researched for their antimicrobial properties. Important compounds include Phylloseptin-1, which is potent in eliminating Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (Zhang et al. 2010), Phylloseptins-S, which is an anti-parasitic against the promastigote of Leishmania infantum, Leishmania braziliensis, and Leishmania major (although toxic to mammalian cells)(Raja et al. 2013), and Sauvagine, which is used in the pharmacy industry for its linked similarity to urotensin I and as aid in diuresis, cardiovascular system, and endocrine system functions (Mantecucchi and Henschen 1980).

Through the sequencing of 12 nuclear and mitochondrial genes, plus three intervening tRNA sequences, P. sauvagii is found to belong to the family Hylidae, the subfamily Phyllomedusinae, and the genus Phyllomedusa. Thirty species belong to this genus, which contains two main clades and four main groups. However, the four groups do not encompass all species within the genus (Salica et al. 2011). Phyllomedusa sauvagii does not belong to any of the four groups. The clade that P. sauvagii belongs to includes P. boliviana, P. camba, P. bicolor, P. vailantii, and the P. burmeisteri and P. tarsius groups. Phyllomedusa sauvagii is the sister taxon to the P. burmeisteri group, and P. boliviana is the sister taxon to P. sauvagii and the P. burmeisteri group. Phyllomedusa sauvagii is â€œone of the most highly specialized members of the evolutionary line,â€ due to its â€œreduced discs on the digits and the prominent parotoid glandsâ€ (Faivovich et al. 2010).

The genera name means leaf guardian where â€œphylloâ€ is Greek for leaf and â€œmedousaâ€ is Greek for guardian. The species epithet, ""sauvagii"", was named after Dr. Henri-Emile Sauvage, a French paleontologist, herpetologist, and ichthyologist who lived from 1844 to 1917 (Boelens et al. 2013).

Phyllomedusa tomopterna requires pristine rainforest. This species is most common in Suriname; elsewhere in its range it is not considered common.  It is not considered threatened except where individual populations are impacted by deforestation. Its range overlaps with a number of protected areas: in Brazil, it is found in the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke; In Ecuador, it is found in the Parque Nacional YasunÃ­, Reserva de ProducciÃ³n de FaunÃ­stica Cuyabeno, and Reserva BiolÃ³gica Limoncocha; in Peru it is found in Parque Nacional Manu; in Venezuela, it is found in the Reserva Forestal Imataca.  The Venezuelan population in the Reserva Forestal Imataca may become endangered as logging proceeds (La Marca et al. 2008).

Phyllomedusa vaillantii is a medium size frog the exhibits sexual dimorphism. Males have snouts that appear angular from above and nearly truncate. In females, the snout appears rounded from above and inclined anteroventrally. Snout-vent lengths range from 50.2 - 57.5 mm in males and 68.8 - 81.2 mm in females (but see Lima et al. 2005, which states male SVL is 58 - 65 mm and females are 74 - 83 mm). Its elevated parotid glands are angular and extend to the sacrum, displayed with longitudinal row of white granules along the edge of the gland. The first finger is opposable and shorter the second. Conversely, the first toe is opposable and longer to the second. There are moderately large discs on fingers and toes. The forearm of this species is slender. Dorsal skin is rough, particularly tubercular on the hind limbs of its adult frogs (Duellman 1974). 

Phyllomedusa tarsius and Phyllomedusa bicolor are similar to Phyllomedusa vaillantii. However, Phyllomedusa tarsius differs by its orange-red iris with a network of black reticulations. Phyllomedusa bicolor differs by its light brown fingers with green adhesive discs (Lima et al. 2005). 

In life, the dorsal skin and sides of head are green. The flanks viewed from above are colored green, whereas the flanks from below are colored reddish brown; this change in color is separated by a row of longitudinal, oval cream to pale orange spots. The front and back surfaces of the thighs range from reddish brown to lavender with small spots of cream to pale orange. The ventral skin is pale grayish-orange with gray reticulations present in smaller members of the species and dull grayish brown reticulations in larger ones. Throat is decorated with two lavender cream spots. A large pale green spot surrounded by cream coloration can be observed on the chest. The lower lip is cream color. The iris is pale gray with a greenish hue. The eyelids are clear (Duellman 1974).

Phyllomedusa vaillantii is an Amazonian species that can be found in parts of Guyana, French Guiana, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, and northern Bolivia (Duellman 1974; Lima et al. 2005). 	

This species occurs throughout the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke in Brazil, where it is most commonly found in larger ponds with stream connections  (Lima et al. 2005).
","
Phyllomedusa vaillantii is arboreal and nocturnal. Males call on branches near ponds. Reproduction occurs in the rainiest months. The species lay clutches of about 600 eggs, within a gelatinous mass, in leaf nests over ponds. The tadpoles that fall into the water after hatching are brilliant orange, and can be distinguished from P. bicolor because they have a black spot between the eyes (Lima et al. 2005). 

The tadpoles of Phyllomedusa vaillantii were observed to segregate in schools based on size during the day but appeared spread out during the night. Size based assortment could be explained by kin recognition and preference, which has been shown in the lab (Branch 1983). 

Tadpoles exhibited contagious air breathing during the day but not at night. Phyllomedusa vaillantii tadpoles also exhibited temporal shifts in feeding behavior even though food choice was constant among the tadpoles. Laboratory experiments suggest that behavioral shifts of the tadpoles are influenced by light rather than cued by endogenous rhythms (Branch 1983).

Plectrohyla guatemalensis is a fairly small hylid frog, with a snout-vent length range of 40.0 - 52.1 mm for adult males and a range of 42.1 - 54.1 mm for adult females. The head is about the same width as the body, and slightly wider than it is long. The snout is short and bluntly rounded when viewed from the profile and ventrum. From the dorsal view, the snout is acuminate. The slightly protruding nostrils are positioned dorsolaterally and closer to the eye than the snout. The canthus rostralis is nearly straight with an angular ridge. The loreal region is concave, but the internarial and interorbital regions are flat. The eye-nostril distance is about 80% of the diameter of the large eye. The tympanum and tympanic annulus are indistinct. The upper third of the tympanum is covered by a heavy supratympanic fold that extends from the posterior corner of the eye and extends to the arm insertion. The lips are rounded, and in breeding males, swollen. Individuals of this species have no vocal slits or vocal sacs (Duellman and Campbell 1992).

Plectrohyla guatemalensis has a moderately robust body, with thick skin on the dorsum that is covered with numerous, closely-packed round tubercles. The skin is smooth on the ventral surfaces of forelimbs, thighs and shanks, but granular on the throat, belly, posterior, and posteroventral surfaces of thighs. The vent is bordered on the sides with vertical dermal folds, located at the mid-level of the thighs, and directed posteroventally (Duellman and Campbell 1992).

 The upper arms and forearms are robust in males, but slender in females. There is no axillary membranes, but both males and females have a row of small tubercles on the ventrolateral surface of the forearm. The hands are large with a low, flat, and bifud palmar tubercle. The fingers are slender with narrow dermal fringes and large round discs. The disc on the third finger is larger than the diameter of the eye. The moderately large subarticular tubercles are subconical, and the large supernumerary tubercles are around, but only found on the proximal segments. The relative length of the fingers is 1 -IV. The males of this species lack nuptial pads, but have massive bifid prepollices, which are extra rudimentary digits on preaxial side of thumb, with a cleft dividing it in two. There is no webbing between the first and second finger, but the outer fingers are about one-fourth webbed  (Duellman and Campbell 1992)

The hind limbs are moderately short and robust. The tibia is about about 50% of the snout vent length and slightly longer than the foot. The distal three-fourths of the tarsus has an inner fold, but no outer fold is present. There is no outer metatarsal tubercle but the inner metatarsal tubercle is flat, elliptical, and visible from the dorsal view. The toes end in discs that are slightly smaller than the fingers. There are dermal fringes from the inner metatarsal tubercle to the discs of the first toe. The relative length of the toes is 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5. The toes are all about four-fifths webbed with a formula of I1 - 2II1 - 2III1 - 2IV2 - 1V. The moderately large subarticular tubercles are round and the small supernumerary tubercles are only found on the proximal segments (Duellman and Campbell 1992). These frogs are not fossorial, so they have no specialized digits for burrowing (Oliveira et al. 2017). 

Three tadpoles of P. guatemalensis at developmental stages 29, 30, and 33, had body lengths of 17.9 mm, 17.2 mm, and 18.0 mm, and total lengths of 44.5 mm, 45.1 mm, and 48.8 mm, respectively. Tadpoles have slightly depressed bodies that are as wide as they are deep. In the dorsal and profile view, the snout of the tadpole is bluntly rounded. The nostrils are pointed dorsolaterally, about halfway between the eye and the tip of the snout. Plectrohyla guatemalensis tadpoles have small, widely separated eyes, which are pointed dorsolaterally. The oral disc is large and ventral without any lateral folds. The disc is completely bordered by a single row of small papillae, and a second row of papillae is present midventrally. Another row of large, discrete papillae is present, medially to the fringe-like papillae on the upper and lower lips. There are also large papillae on the lateral side of the disc. The jaw sheaths of tadpoles are fairly robust, and have short, blunt serrations. The broadly arched upper beak has short lateral line processes, while the lower beak is broadly V-shaped. There are two upper rows of labial teeth and three lower rows, all of about equal lengths, and the ridges which support the second upper row of teeth are discontinuous and are adjoined at the center of the roof the mouth. The spiracle is sinistral, directed posterodorsally, and located around the midway point of the body on the midline. The anal tube is dextral and short. In the dorsal view, the posterior edge of the body is gradually rounded. The caudal musculature is robust and tapers gradually to a point just before the tip of the acutely rounded tail. The dorsal fin does not extend onto the body, and at the mid-tail is the same depth as the tail musculature. The ventral fin depth is shallower than the dorsal fin (Duellman and Campbell 1992).


The bifid prepollical spine distinguishes this genus of frog from others. In general, P. guatemalensis can be differentiated from other members of the genus by having closely-packed dorsal tubercles (Duellman and Campbell 1992). More specifically, P. acanthodes, P. exquisita, P. hartwegi, and P. teuchestes are larger than P. guatemalensis, and do not have red-brown markings on the dorsum; all have a green or gray dorsums (Duellman 2001). Plectrohyla acanthodes also has scattered conical tubercles (Duellman and Campbell 1992), P. hartwegi has vertical, cream-colored bars on the anterior and posterior of the thighs, P. exquisita has yellow coloring in the axilla and groin areas, and P. teuchestes has a smooth dorsum. Plectrohyla pokomchi is of a similar size to P. guatemalensis, but P. pokomchi has a bright green dorsum with dark green tubercles and red webbing, distinguishing it from P. guatemalensis (Duellman 2001). Plectrohyla guatemalensis is very similar to P. calvata, which was split from P. guatemalensis in 2017, but can be distinguished by the latter having a dark dorsum that lacks distinct markings with few tubercles in females and a generally smoother surface in males. Male P. calvata also have somewhat smaller prepollical process (McCrain 2017).

Tadpoles of P. guatemalensis can be distinguished based on mouth parts and nostril position. More specifically, having two rows of small fringing papillae on the lips and approximately equal length labial rows differentiates P. guatemalensis from P. dasypus, P. avia, P. acanthodes, P. quecchi, P. sagorum, P. tecunumani, and P. glandulosa. From P. hartwegi and P. teuchestes the focal species differs in having a smaller oral disc that lacks suction structures. From P. matudia and P. ixil, the focal species can be identified by having an upper jaw sheath with blunt or approximately equal serrations. And lastly, from P. pokomchi, P. guatemalensis differs because its nostrils are halfway between the eyes and the snout (Duellman and Campbell 1992). The nostril placement also differentiates P. guatemalensis from P. chryses, which has nostrils that are closer to the snout tip than eyes (Kaplan et al. 2016) 

The dorsum of P. guatemalensis, in life, is dark green in coloration and can include reddish brown spots. On the thighs and webbing, the posterior surfaces are tan to dull gray with the ventral surfaces being white. The iris is deep bronze. In preservative, dorsal surfaces are a duller, darker or paler brown with uneven and unpredictable dark brown spots. The ventral surface is cream and the posterior sides and flanks of the thighs range from brown to grey (Duellman and Campbell 1992).

In preservative, the larvae of P. guatemalensis appear brown on the dorsum and grey on the ventrum. The caudal musculature appears brown with pale flecks, and the fins are transparent (Duellman and Campbell 1992).

The coloration and texture of the dorsum varies considerably in life. It can appear with or without spots or flecks on its dorsum, and the spots can vary from reddish brown to brown (Duellman and Campbell 1992).

","
The distribution of P. guatemalensis includes the highlands of the Sierra Madre in southeastern Chiapas, Mexico, the southwestern highlands of Guatemala, northern El Salvador, and central Honduras (Duellman and Campbell 1992, McCranie 2017). Plectrohyla guatemalensis can be found in premontane, lower montane, and cloud forests with an elevation range of 950 to 2600 m (Santos-Barrera and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2010).
","
Plectrohyla guatemalensis can be found in arboreal and aquatic habitat, and is usually associated with mountain streams. During the day, adults can be found in crevices near streams and in arboreal bromeliads; at night, adults can be found on stream banks and rocks near streams (Duellman and Campbell 1992, Santos-Barrera and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2010). 

Although male P. guatemalensis do not have vocal slits or sac, males of the species do call from concealed places such as between rocks, arboreal bromeliads, and underground root systems near streams. The single low-pitched call is described as sounding like a grunt and is one low-pitched note that is repeated in two-minute intervals. These calls can be heard from distances of 5 meters in smaller, quiet, montane streams, but are unlikely to be heard in large, fast moving streams. Several males can call from the same location at a time (McCranie et al. 1987). 

Amplexus is axillary with the maleâ€™s arms almost completely encircling the femaleâ€™s body. The male presses his swollen upper lip on the top of the female and may rub his teeth on her head. The purpose of male swollen lips has not been tested, but the rubbing on the female head appears similar to the use of mental gland by salamanders to initiate ovulation (Duellman and Campbell 1992). 

Plectrohyla guatemalensis is oviparous and it is believed eggs are laid at the bottom of shallow streams, in the roots of shrubs and trees. A clutch of presumably P. guatemalensis eggs was found that contained 240 eggs and with each egg measuring 3.4 mm in diameter (Duellman and Campbell 1992, McCranie et al. 1987).

Plectrohyla guatemalensis tadpoles slowly develop in cold mountain streams (Duellman and Campbell 1992). 

Plectrohyla guatemalensis  can be found in sympatry with Plectrohyla euthysanotu (Duellman and Campbell 1992).


","

","
Plectrohyla guatemalensis is listed as â€œCritically Endangeredâ€ on the IUCN Red List because of population declines attributed habitat loss and potentially to chytridiomycosis. Populations are decreasing most in Guatemala and El Salvador, and the species has not been seen in Mexico since 1944 (Santos-Barrera and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2010). 

They are currently protected in El Salvador within Montecristo National Park (Greenbaum and Komar 2005) and their range includes in protected parks or forests in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. However, because of the threat of chytridiomycosis a captive-breeding program may be needed for the species survival (Santos-Barrera and Canseco-MÃ¡rquez 2010).

Although, genetic analysis of the species has been limited by tissue sample availability, studies have compared genetic sequences of P. guatemalensis to P. chrysopleura, P. grlandulosa, and P. matudai (by Duellman et al. 2016) and to P. arborescandens, P. bistincta, P. calfhula, P. chryses, P. cyclada, P. grandulosa, P. matudai, P. mykter, and P. aff. thorectes (by Kaplan et al. 2016). These studies were consistent in the results of P. guatemalensis being is sister to Plectrohyla matudai.

Plectrohyla guatemalensis was long thought to be a composite species and several species, including P. calvata, P. pokomchi and P. tecunumani, have all been split from it (Duellman and Campbell 1992, McCraine 2017). 


Plectrohyla guatemalensis gets its genus name from the Greek words â€œplektronâ€, which means â€œspurâ€, and â€œHylasâ€, a character from Greek mythology (Duellman et al. 2016) 

The species epithet, â€œguatemalensisâ€ comes from the country it was originally found in, Guatemala (Brocchi 1887).

Plectrohyla guatemalensis was initially placed in the genus as Plectrohyla but later the same year assigned to a new genus, Cauphias to accommodate a species thought to be closely related. Plectrohyla guatemalensis was assigned to Hyla guatemalensis by Boulenger in 1882. However in 1941, Hartweg argued that it should be placed in Plectrohyla guatemalensis because the terminal phalanges were not truly T-shaped terminal phalanges (Hartweg 1941).

Plectrohyla matudai is a relatively small species, with males having an observed snout-vent length range of 31.5 - 46.0 mm and females a range of 36.0 - 49.0 mm. However, specimens from the western part of this speciesâ€™ distribution can attain a larger size. The top of the head is flat and the head is as wide as its body. In the dorsal and lateral views, the species has a truncated snout whose length is equal to the diameter of its eye. The nostrils, situated at the end of the snout, protrude and are directed dorsolaterally. The loreal region is almost flat. The slightly flared lips are moderately thick. The sharply angular canthus rostralis is somewhat elevated. The eye and tympanum are separated by a distance that is slightly greater than the tympanum diameter. The posterior edge of the tympanum is indistinct, however, the tympanumâ€™s anterior and ventral edges are usually well defined. The moderately heavy supratympanic fold extends posteriorly from the eye, above and across the tympanum, moving downward to a point above the shoulder. The fold obscures the upper edge of the tympanum. The vocal slit extends from a midlateral base on the tongue to the angle of the jaws. A subgular vocal sac is present as well, though it is only moderately distensible (Hartweg 1941, Duellman 2001). 

The speciesâ€™ arms are relatively short and robust, and in some breeding males, the arms show signs of swelling. A row of longitudinal tubercles is present on the ventrolateral edge of the forearm. There is a transverse dermal fold on the wrist. The palmar tubercle is elevated and bifid. The prepollex is moderately enlarged and is curved at the end. In some male specimens a sharp prepollical spine also protrudes from the prepollex. The long and slender fingers have moderately large discs with the disc diameter of the third finger being larger than the diameter of the tympanum. The webbing on the hands is vestigial. The large subarticular tubercles are conical with the distal tubercle on the third and fourth fingers being bifid in some individuals. There are also large, subconical supernumerary tubercles present as a single or double row on the proximal segments of the fingers (Duellman 2001). 

The legs are relatively short. When adpressed at right angles to the body, the limbs barely overlap. When adpressed along the body, the tibotarsal articulation reaches the eye. There is no transverse dermal fold on the heel but there is an elevated tarsal fold that extends the length of the tarsus. There are a few small tubercles on the heel and an oval, subconical inner metatarsal tubercle. There is no outer metatarsal tubercle. The long and slender toes have discs that are smaller than those on its fingers. The toes are roughly three-fourths webbed, with the webbing extending from the base of the penultimate phalanxes of each toe. The small subarticular tubercles are conical while the supernumerary tubercles are large and subconical. The supernumerary tubercles are presented in a single row along each toe until the proximal segment at which point they are arranged irregularly (Duellman 2001).

The dorsal skin is tuberculate with tubercles also present on the flanks. The skin on the throat, belly, and ventral surfaces is coarse and granular while the skin on other ventral surfaces is smoother. The anal opening is directed posteroventrally, halfway up its thighs, and its anal sheath is bordered on both sides by a large tubercle (Duellman 2001). 

Tadpoles examined at stage 25 had body lengths of 10.5 to 13.1 mm, and total lengths of 29.5 to 38.2 mm. Typical tadpoles in developmental stage 28 have a body length of 13.7 mm and a total length of 40.5 mm. Plectrohyla matudai tadpoles have an ovoid body that is slightly wider than it is deep. From the dorsal view, the snout is bluntly rounded, while in the lateral view the snout is truncated. The nostrils situated midway between the eyes and the tip of the snout. The eyes are small and are directed dorsolaterally. The mouth is ventral and is of a moderately large size, roughly two-thirds of the tadpolesâ€™ body length. The mouth is bordered entirely by a single row of short papillae. However, medial to this row of papillae sits an irregular row of larger papillae. The upper part of the beak is broad and barely arched, with long and pointed serrations present. One serration on each side is enlarged into a fang-like projection. The lower part of the beak is narrow, forming a broad and curved arch. The lower beak also bears small, pointed serrations. Two upper and three lower rows of teeth are present. The upper rows are long and equal in length, though the second upper row is interrupted medially. The first and second lower rows are equal in length to each other, though noticeably shorter than the upper rows, and the third lower row is shorter than the first and second rows. The sinistral spiracle has an opening roughly midway on the bodyâ€™s length at the midline. The cloacal tube is long and positioned dextrally. The tail has heavy caudal musculature that extends to the rounded tip and shallow caudal fins. The tailâ€™s dorsal fin is deeper than that of the ventral fin and neither extends onto the body. The dorsal fin is deepest at the mid-length of the tail, but at that point the caudal musculature is still much deeper (Duellman 2001). 

Plectrohyla matudai, like P. quecchi, P. sagorum,  and P. ixil (three similarly sized species within genus Plectrohyla) has a pointed prepollical spine. However, P. matudai has a vertical rostral keel that distinguishes the focal species from P. quecchi and P. sagorum. More tuberculated skin differentiates it from P. ixil and P. sagorum. Additionally,  P. ixil has a pale lateral stripe and acuminate snout, which P. matudai does not. Other members of Plectrohyla are larger and lack vocal slits, allowing them to be easily differentiated from P. matudai (Duellman and Campbell 1992, Duellman 2001). 

Plectrohyla matudai tadpoles can be differentiated from other of their genus by their mouthparts. The focal species is most easily differentiated from P. guatemalensis by the former having one row of fringed papillae instead of two, very few lateral papillae, shorter upper tooth rows, a third lower tooth row that is much shorter than the others, and fang-like serrations on the upper beak. Fewer lateral papillae and fang-like upper beak serrations also differentiate the focal species from P. ixil and P. sagorum. More lateral papillae and fang-like serrations on the upper beak differentiate the focal species from P. quecchi and P. glandulosa (Duellman 2001).

In life, Plectrohyla matudai has a tan to pale brown dorsum covered with darker brown, olive brown, or black reticulations or flecks. In some specimens, metallic green flecks can be found on dorsal surfaces. There is typically a dark, narrow stripe on the upper lip and below the eye. The area below the shoulder is typically a plain or bluish gray with a thin outline of black. Narrow, dark bars or flecks are present on the limbâ€™s dorsal surfaces. The thighs are typically a creamy tan color anteriorly, while the posterior surfaces of the thigh are pale brown. A dark, irregular stripe extends from the supratympanic fold nearly to P. matudaiâ€™s groin, separating the dorsal coloration from the cream color on the frogsâ€™ flanks. This stripe is sometimes fragmented, resulting in a series of dashes or flecks, or is absent entirely. The venter is creamy white and the vocal sac a grayish brown. The iris is coppery-tan with fine black reticulations. In preservative, dorsum becomes a dull brown with darker brown or black markings. On the thighs, the anterior and posterior surfaces become pale tan or brown. The ventrum becomes creamy tan or pale grayish brown (Duellman 2001).

In life, tadpoles of Plectrohyla matudai have a brown body with tan caudal musculature that is speckled with reddish-brown flecks. These flecks are often present on caudal fins as well. The tadpolesâ€™ irises are a dull bronze in color. In preservative, the body becomes a dull or grayish brown with tan, pinkish caudal musculature covered in brown flecks (Duellman 2001).

","
Plectrohyla matudai is widely, but disjointedly, distributed in cloud and pine-oak forests at elevations of 700 to 2600 meters on the Pacific versant from extreme southeastern Oaxaca, Mexico, through south-central Guatemala to the mountains of south-western Honduras. Plectrohyla matudai can also be found in pine-oak forests within the Griljava Depression in Chiapas and Guatemala as well as in the Las Nubes Block in Central Guatemala (Duellman 2001).

Plectrohyla matudai can be found during the day and at night in primary cloud and pine-oak forests on vegetation along small cascading streams (Duellman 2001).

Plectrohyla matudaiâ€™s call is described as a sharp, single note that resembles â€œtwo pebbles struck together underwater,â€ repeated at intervals of about two minutes. Calling males are typically seen sitting on vegetation, though there are reports of them calling from the water as well (Taylor and Smith 1945, Duellman 2001). 

Of four females examined in 1992, there was a range of 101 - 144 ovarian eggs, with the diameter of the eggs ranging between 1.9 and 2.5 mm (Duellman and Campbell 1992). 

Tadpoles develop in cascading streams, where they typically adhere to boulders in areas of the stream that are less turbulent (Duellman 2001). 

Plectrohyla matudai often coincides sympatrically with P. sagorum and P. guatemalensis as the three species have largely overlapping distributions. However, P. guatemalensis typically inhabits larger mountain streams unlike P. sagorum and P. matudai (Duellman 2001).

","

","
Although Plectrohyla matudai is listed as a species of â€œLeast Concernâ€ by the IUCN Red List, the species is still threatened by habitat loss or disturbance due to agriculture, logging, and human urban development. Chytridiomycosis is also considered a threat to P. matudai populations. However, adults of this species seem to be relatively resistant to chytrid infections, especially when compared to other species in the Plectrohyla genus. The risk Chytridiomycosis poses is still notable though, because younger life stages of P. matudai are highly susceptible (IUCN 2016).

The species authority is:  Hartweg, N. (1941). ""Notes on the genus Plectrohyla, with descriptions of new species.â€ Occasional Papers of the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan. 437: 1â€“10.

Analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences indicate that P. matudai is part of the Plectrohyla guatemalensis group, rather than the Hyla bistincta group (Faivovich et al. 2005).  

Three morphological characteristics of P matudai and P. ixil were considered similar enough to group them as sister species: the lack of articulation between their squamosal and crista parotica, the presence of linea masculinea (bands of fibrous connective tissue), and the presence of enlarged, fanglike serrations on their upper jaw sheath as tadpoles (Duellman and Campbell 1992). 

Molecular phylogenies suggest that the genus Sarcohyla and Plectrohyla are sister genera. Trees estimated with the nuclear genes Rag-1 and POMc support the monophyly of the Sarcohyla and Plectrohyla clades, however, only Plectrohyla's monophyly was supported by trees constructed using analysis of the 12s and ND1 mitochondrial genes (Caviedes-Solis and de Oca 2018). 

The genus, â€œPlectrohylaâ€ is derived from the Greek, â€œplectronâ€ meaning â€œspurâ€, referring to their prepollical spine and â€œHylasâ€ of Greek mythology (Duellman et al. 2016).

The species epithet, ""matudaiâ€, is named in honor of Eizi Matuda, a botanist from Chiapas, Mexico who helped arrange Norman Hartwegâ€™s expedition to Chiapas (Hartweg 1941, Duellman 2001).

Pseudacris crucifer is a small species of frog, ranging from .75 of an inch to 1.25 inches in total length. A characteristic 'X' mark can usually be seen on the back of the frog. While P. crucifer displays no distinct color patterns on its surface, its observed color may be yellow, brown, gray or olive. This species may be distinguished from other members of the genus by its lack in distinct stripes, mottling, spotting, and the characteristic 'X' mark. 
 
P. c. bartramiana. and P. c. crucifer are subspecies 
 
 

","
Geographically, this species may be found from the Canadian Maritime Provinces to northern Florida, and from southeast Manitoba all the way to eastern Texas. One isolated (but natural) population exists in Kansas and an introduced population exists into Cuba. P. crucifer tends to be found in large numbers near ponds or swamps in brushy growth or cutover woodlands. Small, temporary or semipermanent lentic environments are ideal water sources for P. crucifer. Standing trees or shrubs provide a popular habitat for the choral groups to form. 
 
 
 

","
 The breeding season is the best time to see and hear P. crucifer in the wild. Occasionally, individuals may be seen during the day in damp or rainy weather. 
The call of this species resembles that of sleigh bells when heard from a distance. A terminal upward slur characterizes the high, single, clear whistle that is repeated at intervals of approximately 1 second. In the background of small choruses, a trilling peep may be uttered by some individuals.

Pseudacris nigrita is a small frog with a snout-vent length ranging from 19 - 32 mm. The head and body are narrow, and the snout is pointed. Thereâ€™s basal webbing between the second, third, and fourth toes. The tips of the digits are moderately expanded (Gates 1988).

At the time of hatching, larvae are approximately 4.5 mm long. The maximum length of larvae can be up to 35.0 mm long. Newly-transformed froglets are between 8.5 and 15.0 mm long (Gates 1988).

Pseudacris nigrita resembles cricket frogs of the genus Acris. However, cricket frogs have prominent stripes near their rear thigh, and these are absent in P. nigrita. Additionally, P. nigrita has a snout that is notably more pointed than other species of chorus frogs (Conant and Collins 1998).

In life, Pseudacris nigritaâ€™s dorsal surface can be between tan and black in color, often with three dark, horizontal stripes or rows of dots. The middle stripe extends up to the snout, but not all individuals have it. The upper lip may have small spots, wavy streaks, or a distinct stripe of white. Pseudacris nigrita has a dark band extending from the snout to the groin, trailing along the side of the body. The limbs appear either striped or spotted, with darker bars along the tibia. The ventral surface is typically a pale yellow and may be speckled with dark spots. Males have smooth, green-ish yellow to orange throats (Gates 1988).

In life, at hatching, P. nigrita larvae have a light lateral stripe that extends from the eye to the tail. Dark melanophore spots can be seen in the dorsal tail fin, and the tail musculature is tan above and a dull yellow below. The chest and abdomen are dull yellow as well. Pseudacris nigrita at Gosner stage 37, have a dark brown dorsal surface with golden specks and black spots. The tail fins are covered with melanophores. The ventral surface is dark, except for the center of the abdomen, which is golden in color. This gold area often forms a triangle pointing anteriorly (Gates 1988).

Pseudacris nigrita is commonly split into two subspecies: Pseudacris nigrita nigrita and Pseudacris nigrita verrucosa. Like most chorus frogs, P. nigrita nigrita has a white upper lip. P. nigrita verrucosa, however, has a black upper lip (Conant and Collins 1998).

","
Pseudacris nigrita can be found in most regions of the southeastern United States, including in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. They largely inhibit inner wetlands and forest habitats (IUCN 2014).

","
Pseudacris nigrita breeds in a variety of small, shallow waters, including small ponds, puddles, and roadside ditches. Some specimens have also been collected from meadows and woods (Martof and Thompson 1958). 

Ideal breeding locations have shallow water and many kinds of grass and vegetation. Their breeding season is long, beginning in November and ending in April. The most active breeding occurs during rainy weather (Martof and Thompson 1958).

The P. nigrita call is described as a musical trill (Conant and Collins 1998). Frog calls can be heard at the beginning of the breeding season, in November, but large â€œchorusesâ€ -- used to describe large groups of calling frogs -- are not heard until December and January when it rains. Choruses and breeding behavior may be interrupted by cold weather, but the choruses continue largely-uninterrupted through March. By April, there are notably fewer choruses, but scattered calls can be heard through May (Martof and Thompson 1958).


","

","
Pseudacris nigrita has an IUCN status of ""Least Concern"" because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and apparent tolerance to habitat modification. Local subpopulations are threatened by clear-cutting and urbanization, but overall, the species does not have any major threats. 
","

","
Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian methods were used to analyze 12S, tRNAval, and 16S rRNA mtDNA genes of the Pseudacris genus, with consistent results. Four distinct clades were identified: West Coast, Fat Frogs, Crucifer, and Trilling Frogs. Pseudacris nigrita is a member of the â€œtrilling frog clade,â€ which includes the nigrita clade and a sister group of P. brimleyi and P. brachyphona (Moriarty and Cannatella  2004). The nigrita clade includes P. clarkii,  P. feriarum, P. fouquettei P. kalmi, P. maculata, P. nigrita, and P. triseriata . The nigrita clade was further split into three clades based on geographic divisions: those west of the Mississippi River, including P. maculata and triseriata, those in the southeastern United States, P. fouquettei and P. nigrita, and northeastern US species including P. feriarum, P. kalmi, and P. triseriata. The sister species of P. nigrita is P. fouquettei, which was described in 2008 (Moriarty and Cannatella  2004, Moriarty Lemmon et al. 2008).

Pseudacris nigrita is split into two subspecies: P. nigrita nigrita and P. nigrita verrucosa. However, Moriarty and Cannatella (2004) discourage the recognition and usage of these subspecies, claiming that they are uninformative.

The species epithet, â€œnigritaâ€ is a reference to the overall dark coloration of Pseudacris nigrita (Gates 1988).

The Pacific Chorus frog is a small frog, about 3/4 to 2 inches, that has expanded toe disks and a black eye-stripe (Stebbins 1985). The stripe runs from the tip of the snout posteriorly through the eye to the forelimb insertion (Grismer 2002).   
The stripe may be hard to see in dark frogs, but it is always present. The dorsal coloration is highly variable, and can be gray, tan, green, brown, or black, and it may change color from dark to light within a few minutes. It often has a triangular dark spot on the head and dark spots on the back and legs, and the clarity of these spots changes as the frog changes its color phase. Its limbs are crossbanded or blotched with dark color, and the posterior has a yellow or orange color, especially on the under surfaces of the limbs, the rear of the femur, and in the groin. Males have a wrinkled and dusky throat. When the maleâ€™s vocal sac is deflated, often 8 to 12 longitudinal folds are present (Stebbins 1985).   
It has webbed hind toes with a margin of the web between successive toes. Skin is usually smooth with a few tubercles but occasionally quite rough. It has a round tympanum, that is anywhere from 1/4 to slightly over 1/2 the size of the eye opening, located in the eye stripe. The thenar tubercle is elongated and ovoid, while the palmar tubercle is made of 3 small, closely associated tubercles totaling the size of the thenar tubercle (Stebbins 1951).

Distributed from mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island through Washington, Oregon, California, and the tip of Baja California. P. regilla can be found on Catalina, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz, islands off the coast of southern California, and on Isla Cedros, an island off the west coast of central Baja California. Distribution also extends east to eastern Nevada and western Montana. It lives in habitats from sea level to 11,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada (Grismer 2002).   
This species seeks cover in many places, including rock fissures, under bark, in vegetation along streams, in rodent and other burrows, in nooks and crannies in buildings, and in culverts. It can be found in springs, ponds, irrigation canals, streams, and other bodies of water, but it has also been found as far as Â½ mile from water (Stebbins 1951).  
Out of the water, it frequents habitats like grassland, chaparral, woodland, desert oases, forest, and farmland (Stebbins 1985).  
 
 
 
 
 

","
Breeding: P. regilla breeds over a long period of time, from January to the middle of May, in marshes, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, roadside ditches, and slow streams (Stebbins 1985).   
In interior British Colombia, it may breed in June and July also. Later breeding occurs in higher altitudes. Around January, at the beginning of the breeding season, large numbers of vociferous males congregate at transient rain pools and more permanent bodies of water. The females do not enter the water until later, when they are ready to lay. Usually, females enter in the late afternoon or early evening, and mating and egg laying usually occurs by the following morning. Females enter either by themselves or in small groups, so there are many more males than females, making immediate mating probable. Usually, there is a preliminary period of clasping that lasts anywhere from 4 to 24 hours in a laboratory, and probably about 4 to 10 hours in nature. The male tightly grips the female with is forelimbs, but does not contact her with his body behind his pectoral region except when inseminating eggs. The maleâ€™s legs are flexed in a sitting pose, and insemination occurs at the moment of the extrusion of the eggs. The male discharges a quantity of transparent semen by bringing his cloacal aperture close to that of the female. With a quick, firm extension, the male slides his feet posteriorly over the sides and hips of the female, then retracts to his previous position. Simultaneously, the female extrudes a clutch of eggs into the cloud of sperm. The female sometimes scratches the substratum on which the eggs are going to be deposited before releasing the eggs. As the female extrudes the eggs, her cloaca is brought close to this surface and their attachment is effected. The eggs may be removed from her cloaca by her tarsi through flexor-extensor reflexes. The interval between layings is usually 2 to 10 minutes, but could be longer. After oviposition, the frogs separate. Amplexus is pectoral, and may last from 8 to 40 hours or longer (Smith 1940).  
 
Eggs: Clusters of eggs are deposited in a pondâ€™s shallow water, usually at depths above 4 inches. The clusters can be attached to sticks, leaves, vegetation, or other objects, and they can also be found floating on the surface, usually attached to objects. Eggs are usually laid in loose clusters of irregular shape, and the cluster has 2 gelatinous envelopes. The outer envelope is 4.78 to 6.7 mm and is sticky, and the inner envelope is 1.88 to 2.70 mm. Each packet usually has 22 to 25 eggs, but could have anywhere from 5 to 60 eggs.  As the layings near an end, the number of eggs per clutch can decrease to 3 or 4, or even single eggs (Livezey and Wright 1947).  

Larva: The tadpole is about 45 mm long, full and deep-bodied, and has a fairly long tail, about 2 times the head and body length. The labial tooth row formula is 2/3, and the spiracle is sinistral, directed posteriorly (Grismer 2002).   
The general color is blackish and yellowish brown to dark brown with heavy black spots. Below, it is whitish with bronze or copper tinges. The tail is mottled with black, and the iris is golden, with a darker area anterior and posterior to the pupil (Stebbins 1951).  
 
Call: P. regilla is the most commonly heard frog species on the Pacific coast. The calls last for about 1 second and are often uttered in sequence. Each 1-second call consists of a loud, two-parted 'kreck-ek', with rising inflection in the last syllable. P. regilla has a round vocal sac (Stebbins 1985).  
While singing, a male may float with his limbs outstretched and his globular pouch extended to or beyond his chin (Stebbins 1951).

Food: P. regilla eats insects, including leaf-hoppers, spring-tails, flies, stoneflies, ants, wasps, beetles, and caterpillars, It also eats spiders, isopods, and snails (Stebbins 1972).  

Behavior: P. regilla is mainly nocturnal, but it is also active in the daytime. Sometimes, at low elevations, it is active throughout the year. It is a good climber, but usually stays near the ground. It has a great capacity for color change, and a change from an unspotted dark coloration through a medium light colored phase with spots to an unspotted light phase may take about 8 to 10 minutes (Stebbins 1951).

","
A similar species, Pseudacris cadaverina, the California Treefrog, usually does not have an eye-stripe, has larger toe pads, and more fully webbed hind toes. The California Treefrog also is rarely green. Another similar species, Hyla eximia, the Mountain Treefrog, the eye-stripe extends beyond the shoulder and webbing is reduced (Stebbins 1985).  

It is certain that there are isolated populations of P. regilla in many unexplored canyons of the Sierra la Giganta that harbor hidden permanent springs. In some water systems west of San Ignacio, there is evidence that P. regilla is being displaced by the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana (Grismer 2002).  

This species was featured in News of the Week 28 March 2022: 
The amphibian skin microbiome plays an important role in protecting its hosts against pathogens such as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), one of the causative agents of chytridiomycosis. Bd is comprised of multiple genetic lineages that may exhibit differences in their ability to cause disease. Basanta et al. (2021) investigated if differences in Bd genetic variation are linked to differences in the amphibian skin microbiome. They studied associations between Bd infection load, Bd genetic diversity, and skin bacterial communities in populations of Pseudacris regilla (=Hyliola regilla (hypochondriaca)) of Baja California, Mexico. They found that Bd isolates have genetic spatial structure, and the Bd genetic differences and infection load are correlated with the skin bacterial community composition of P. regilla. Their results indicate that skin-associated bacteria and Bd strains likely interact on the host skin, highlighting this key microbial interaction as an important factor in shaping amphibian-Bd disease dynamics.

Pseudacris streckeri can reach a maximum size of 48 mm.  It is the largest of the chorus frogs,  with a stout, toadlike body and forearms.  This frog has a dark stripe through its eyes from snout to shoulder, dark spots along the side of the body, dark blotches on the dorsum (back), a white belly, and yellow or orange-yellow pigmentation on the groin.  Coloration may be gray, brown, olive, or green in the subspecies P. streckeri streckeri, but the dorsum is never green in the subspecies P. streckeri illinoisensis. Most P. streckeri have a dark spot below the eye. P. streckeri can be distinguished from all other chorus frogs within its range by its lack of a continuous light line along the upper lip. During the breeding season, the vocal pouch of the male becomes dark. 
","
One subspecies, P. s. streckeri, occurs in south-central Kansas through Oklahoma and down into eastern Texas, as well as west-central Arkansas and western Louisiana. This subspecies can be found in a variety of habitats: shady woods, stream edges, cultivated fields, rocky ravines, sand prairies, or associated with lagoons or cypress swamps.   
 
The other subspecies, P. s. illinoisensis, is found in disjunct populations in west-central and southwest Illinois, southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. It prefers mainly sand prairies and cultivated fields.
","
This nocturnal frog is fossorial, burrowing in the soil in order to shield itself from predation and heat. While most burrowing frogs dig backward with their hind legs, P. streckeri is unusual in digging forward with its front legs and entering the hole headfirst. It is one of only a handful of burrowing frog species to do so. 
It emerges from the sand after early spring rains in order to breed. P. streckeri breeds in flooded fields, ditches, small ponds, and vernal pools.  The breeding call of Strecker's Chorus Frog is composed of a series of clear, high-pitched single-note whistles, resembling that of Pseudacris ornata, the Ornate Chorus Frog.  The sound of a large chorus of P. streckeri has been described as ""a rapidly turning pulley wheel badly in need of greasing."" Eggs are deposited in water attached to submerged vegetation, and hatch within a few days; the tadpoles transform in two months.  
 
P. streckeri primarily eats small insects.

The subspecies P. s. illinoisensis has been reported to be threatened in Illinois by the  
 Illinois Natural History Survey.

Pseudacris triseriata  is a small hylid frog that can grow to 39 mm in length but averages 10-37 mm, with females larger than males.  The color ranges from gray to brown dorsally, with a creamy venter.  Dorsal markings may vary, but usually include three dark narrow, longitudinal stripes which may be broken up into three rows of spots.  A dark triangle may occur between the eyes. A white stripe runs along the upper lip.  Toes are unwebbed.  Males have dark throats during breeding seasons.
","
They can be found throughout the state of Arkansas.  They live in wooded areas near swamps and at the edge of marshes.
","
The call of the male is a continous series of short trills, ""Prreep-prreep-prreep,"" lasting for one or two seconds.  Breeding occurs in late February or early March and ends by late April.  Females lay from 500-1500 eggs total, in clusters of 20-100.
","

","
This species of frog has adapted well to urbanization so it is not threatened.

","
Scinax boulengeri is moderately sized. Adult males range from 36 to 49 mm, while adult females range from 42 to 53 mm snout-vent length (Savage 2002). Scinax boulengeri has a pointed, acuminate snout, tuberculate dorsum, white vocal sac, long webless fingers with truncated discs, and thighs marked by a contrasting pattern of black and yellow or green vertical bars. A dark spot is commonly found on the groin (Duellman 2001). It has a distinctive shape due to a strongly flattened body and protruding nostrils (Guyer 2005).

Dorsally, the skin is tuberculate.  The ventral surfaces of the limbs have smooth skin, but the belly and the posteroventral surfaces of the thighs have granular skin.  Individuals from Costa Rica (the Golfo Dulce region) are more tuberculate than those from the Caribbean lowlands of Central America (Duellman 2001). The top of the head is slightly convex and the lips are flared. The long snout is acuminate in both lateral and dorsal profiles, with the tip extending beyond the lower jaw. The nostrils point dorsolaterally and are positioned just above the leading edge of the lower jaw. A thin dermal fold runs from the posterior edge of the eye, above the tympanum, to just above the insertion of the arm. This fold covers the upper edge of the tympanum.  The tongue is narrowly heart-shaped.  Vocal slits extend to the angle of the jaw. There is a single, median vocal sac which is moderately distendable (Duellman 2001).

The arm lacks an axillary membrane and is moderately long and slender. The ventrolateral edge of the forearm has no tubercles and the wrist has no transverse fold. The long and thin fingers are unwebbed and have large truncate discs, with the width of the third finger's disc about equal to the tympanum. Narrow dermal fringes are present on the edges of the digits. Each digit also has small, conical supernumerary tubercles on its proximal segment. Large, round subarticular tubercles are present.  There is a single flat, tripartite palmar tubercle, and an elongated, flat prepollical tubercle.  Duellman (2001) states that males do not possess nuptial excrescences on the prepollex, which is only slightly enlarged, but Savage (2002) directly contradicts this and says that adult males have whitish nuptial pads. Hindlimbs are also moderately long and slender. The tibiotarsal articulation extends to a point between the eye and the nostril. There is a weak tarsal fold, and a thin transverse dermal fold on the heel, as well as one or two tubercles. The inner metatarsal tubercle is low, flat, and rounded. The outer metatarsal tubercle is small and conical when present. Toes are long and slender, with truncate discs nearly as large as those on the fingers. The toes are about three-fourths webbed, with the webbing on the first and second toes present as a fringe on the medial side of the first toe and the lateral edge of the second toe. The subarticular tubercles are large and rounded. Small, rounded supernumerary tubercles are present in a single row on the proximal segment of each digit.


 Scinax boulengeri is grayish tan, brown, or dull green with darker brown markings, which usually consist of a dark triangular mark between the eyes and two or more dark blotches on the back.  Forearms, thighs, shanks, and feet have transverse bars. The iris is bronze. The throat is white, spotted with small gray flecks.  The venter is creamy white, while the groin is pale green with one to several black spots or mottling.  Flanks are pale yellowish green.  The anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs have long, vertical black bars, separated by pale green, yellowish green, or yellow-orange interspaces.  (Duellman 2001). 

 A typical tadpole in developmental stage 38 has a body length of 11.5 mm and total length of 33.5 mm. The larval body is slightly deeper than wide. The snout is rounded, with small, anterolateral nostrils.  The eyes are moderately large and directed laterally. The spiracle is sinistral, with the opening directed posteriorly. The vent (cloacal tube) is short and dextral. The caudal musculature is somewhat shallow and tapers gradually. The caudal fins are deep, with the dorsal fin extending onto the body nearly to the posterior edge of the eye.  The tail tip ends in a sharp point (Duellman 2001). The larval mouth is small and anteroventral, with massive, heavily serrated beaks. The lips have a single lateral row of blunt papillae and also have lateral folds with small conical papillae. There are two upper rows of denticles, which are of equal length and extend to the lip, and three shorter lower rows of teeth. The second upper row is narrowly interrupted medially (Duellman 2001). The lower lip has a catapult-like extension with long, pointed denticles (Savage 2002).

In the wild, the larval body is silvery yellow, the fins are transparent, and the caudal musculature is pale cream. The tail has large, closely spaced black spots on the middle two-thirds of its length. In preserved tadpoles, these spots are the only pigment visible (Duellman 2001).

","
Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama; Pacific slopes from Costa Rica to Ecuador. Scinax boulengeri lives in humid, lowland tropical forests with rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year (Duellman 2001).
","
Scinax boulengeri is nocturnal and arboreal.  It can be found near the forest floor perching on bushes, stumps, logs, and low trees, as well as in secondary growth and isolated trees and shrubs in pastures and open areas (Scott 1983).

This species is a prolonged breeder, with peaks occurring in May/June and again in August. In humid areas males call throughout the year but in drier areas calling occurs from May to November (Savage 2002). Bevier (1997) states that calling was not correlated to the amount of rainfall.  However, this statement differs from other accounts, some of which assert that calling males are more numerous on rainy nights (Guyer 2005). 

Scinax boulengeri males begin congregating at pond breeding sites soon after the first heavy rains of the season (Bevier 1997). The males generally begin their 3 to 4 hour calls at dusk in areas bordering bodies of water, rarely moving from their initial areas during the same night. Males call from secluded spots on stumps or logs while hidden under vegetation, as well as from dense bushes, depressions in logs, and stumps at pondside or in the water (Duellman 2001). Calling rates reduce greatly after the first hour, as do the physical aggressions from establishing territory. Calls consist of a single low and guttural note, emitted over intervals lasting between ten seconds to several minutes, usually with the head down and cocked away from the substrate (Savage 2002; Guyer 2005). Call notes have a fundamental frequency of around 71 cycles/second and two harmonics of 1600 and 2800 cycles/second, with a duration of 0.24 to 0.27 seconds and a pulse rate of 80-120 pulses/second (Duellman 2001).


 Amplexus occurs out of water, and the eggs are laid in shallow water (Savage 2002). The female lays 600-700 eggs in water, each ranging from 1.5 to 1.6 mm. in diameter (Jungfer 1987).  Eggs hatch in 1 to 1.5 days, while tadpoles take 40 to 88 days to reach metamorphosis (Jungfer 1987). 

Tadpoles feed on small crustaceans and other aquatic insect larvae, as well as developing conspecific and heterospecific tadpoles (Savage 2002). The catapult-like, toothed extension of the larval lower lip aids in flipping prey into the mouth (Savage 2002).  The heaviest predation on Scinax boulengeri tadpoles is by other tadpoles, most likely including cannibalistic predation by this species (Roberts 1994).
The adult diet consists of arthropods (Guyer 2005).

","
 Flat-bodied with a long, rounded protruding snout. Tympanum distinct but upper edge is obscured by supratympanic fold. Large, bulging eyes. Horizontally elliptical pupils with dull bronze iris. Fingers are moderately long and slender. Whitish, nonspinous nuptial pad is present on the thumb of adult males. Not much webbing in between fingers and two inner toes. S. elaeochrous has dark green bones (visible through skin on underside of hind limbs). The color of this species varies. They can be uniformly ochre, a patterned dark brown or striped with bright beige or dark brown bands. They can also be yellow, yellowish-green, yellowish tan or olive green. Dorsal surfaces are usually smooth but sometimes have small tubercules. Ground color of dorsal surfaces are yellow green. Females reach a size of 40mm while males are generally no longer than 30mm. Metamorphs are about 13 mm. 
 
Larvae: mouth anteroventral, nostrils anterodorsal, eyes lateral, tail and tail fins are moderate, finely serrate beaks, lower lip with small lateral papillae, yellowish tan body, brown stripe from snout through eye, gold iris. 

","
Common treefrog throughout lowland rainforests of the Caribbean. Lowland Moist and Wet Forests. Found at elevations below 1,000m in the Caribbean lowlands between central Nicaragua and western Panama. A highly arboreal frog, individuals have been found in canopy up to 25m above ground. They are often found sitting on leaves, and can maintain a vertical head-down position after the leaf is bent.
","
Active year-round except for the driest months. Like other hylids, it is primarily nocturnal. Males can be heard calling from cavities such as tree holes. S. elaeochrous breed in temporary ponds during the wet season. After the first torrential rains hit the reproductive site, males suddenly increase calling. Hundreds to thousands call in unison continually for 1 to 2 days. During this time, the males will turn a brighter yellow and their vocal sacs become yellow orange. Throughout this period, males will compete for calling sites. While this scramble is going on, females will also join in and amplexus takes place in the water. Eggs are laid in the pond or adjacent areas of vegetation. They hatch in approximately 1.6 days. Larvae develop in ponds. Tadpoles live in the shallow waters of ponds and hide within the vegetation.
","

","

","

","
Can maintain vertical head-down position on leaf due to mobile inner toes and inner fingers. Can also adhere to vertical leaf by pressing entire flattened body against leaf, having its entire body function as a suction cup. Makes a series of short notes (usually 2-15 but sometimes up to 95!) Higher pitch than S. boulengeri. The two important harmonics are 1.5 and 2.9 kHz and averages 40-50 beats per second.

BR
","
Scinax faivovichi is moderate-sized, slender-bodied frog with male specimens that ranged from 16.2 - 18.8 mm in snout-vent length, and females ranged from 18.8 - 20.6 mm (sample size was 29 specimens, 23 males and 6 females). Their heads are longer than wide. In the profile view, they have a protruding snout, and from the dorsal view they have a subacuminate snout. Also, in the middle of their pronounced, well-defined canthus rostralis, these frogs have a warty protuberance. Their internarial distance is less than their eyeâ€“nostril distance and eye diameter, and their eye diameter is less than their eyeâ€“nostril distance. The species has protruding eyes and a concave region between their eyes and nostrils, the loreal region. They possess a V-shaped indentation between their protuberant nostrils. They have a distinct circular tympanum, which has a diameter that is about half the length of the diameter of their eye. There is a weak supratympanic fold from their shoulder to their tympanic region. They have a discrete subgular vocal sac, a big round tongue, and vomerine teeth in two clusters between their moderate-sized, elliptical choanae (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

They have slender arms, with forearms that are somewhat stout, but smaller than their hands. Their outer metacarpal tubercule is cordiform, the inner metacarpal tubercule is elliptical, and subarticular tubercules are single and rounded. They do not have webbed fingers. Their finger lengths in order from shortest to longest are I + 3+ III 2âˆ’ 3+ IV 3+ âˆ’ 2 V. Their dorsal and ventral skin texture is somewhat rough, or rugose (Brasileiro et al. 2007).
 
One feature that distinguishes this species from all others in the S. perpusillus species group is that its head that is longer than wide. It also has a unique V-shaped indentation between its nostrils, and a brown undersurface on its tarsus and foot. It is smaller than S. alcatraz, S. arduous, S. littoreous, and S. v-signatus. Each of the species in the species group differs from S. faivovichi in additional ways. Scinax alcatraz has a less protruding snout, a less triangular head, less prominent eyes, a less defined canthus rostralis, a less ornamented dorsum, in addition to lacking both a concave loreal region and dark stripes on arms. Scinax arduous has more prominent eyes, a less protruding snout, and more rugose dorsal skin texture. Scinax atratus has a thicker body, less prominent eyes, a less pronounced canthus rostralis, more rugose dorsal skin, and it lacks the dark stripes on its forearms and the gular region with dark spots. Scinax littoreous has a less pronounced canthus rostralis, smoother dorsal skin, less developed finger disks, a less concave loreal region, has white spots on venter as opposed to brown ones, lacks stripes on its arms and forearms, and has a less ornamented dorsum. Scinax melloi differs in that it is smaller, has smoother skin on its back, a more keratinized inner metacarpal tubercule, a less protruding snout, less prominent eyes, and a smaller head. Scinax peixotoi has a thicker body, less prominent eyes, a less protruding snout, a less pronounced canthus rostralis, and has a silvery dorsum as opposed to a brown one. Scinax v-signatus has a larger wider head, a less pronounced canthus rostralis, more rugose dorsal skin, and a V-shaped dark mark on its dorsal side. Scinax perpusillus has a thicker body, a less protruding snout, and more rugose dorsal skin than S. faivovichi (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

In life, the color of this speciesâ€™ dorsal side is greenish-beige and possesses metallic hues. In addition, they have a dark brown interorbital bar. They have a dark brown line on their canthus rostralis, upper eyelids, and supratympanic fold. They also have a thick bright stripe running down their back. One to two brown bars run posteriorly from the edge of each eye to the inguinal region. A concealed part of their shanks are adorned with yellow flash color spots. They have a golden iris, with a horizontally oriented black bar (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

In preservative, the color of this speciesâ€™ dorsal side ranges from creamy to brown. They may or may not have a well-defined interorbital bar, or stripe down their back. In addition, they may or may not have a thick canthus rostralis line or dorsolateral stripes. The pigmentation of the brown bars on the dorsum of their arms also differs amongst individuals. They possess stripes on their thighs running from knee to inguinal region that vary in pigment intensity and location on the thigh. Their throat has dark spots that may appear together in patches. The undersides of their hands, fingers, arms, and thighs are white, while the undersides of their tibiae feet and toes are brown (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

 They display sexual dimorphism, with larger females that lack vocal sacs and vocal slits, and possess a darker colored dorsal side than males (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

","
The species is endemic to Brazil. Within the borders of Brazil, the species is restricted to 24-hectacres in the Ilha de Porcos Pequena, a privately-owned island covered by native preserved Atlantic Forest, at elevations of 0 - 80 m asl (Brasileiro 2008).
","
They are nocturnal and abundant on hot, rainy nights. Males could be heard calling from bromeliad leaves in April, October, and December, but less activity was heard in April. Calling males were positioned with their bodies vertical and head directed skyward (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

Females are also commonly found perched upon bromeliads in their natural range. Like the others in its S. perpusillus species group, these frogs rely on the bromeliad plants for breeding. Tadpoles of this species can be found in the pools of water that form within bromeliads. Researchers found tadpoles during October and December, and thus noted that this suggests their breeding season may align with the early summer rains of September or October (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

","

","
Although S. faivovichi is found at high density within its range, that range is small and isolated. As a result, they face the threat of extinction due to habitat changes or disturbances. Additionally, the island does not have any legal conservation status under federal law leading to the IUCN Redlist classification of this species as â€œCritically Endangeredâ€ (Brasileiro et al. 2007, Brasileiro 2008).
","

","
The species authority is:  Brasileiro, Cinthia A.; Oyamaguchi, Hilton M.; Haddad, Celio F. B. â€œA New Island Species of Scinax (Anura; Hylidae) from Southeastern Brazil.â€ Journal of Herpetology, Vol:41, Iss:2, 271-275.


Scinax faivovichi belongs to the Scinax perpusillus species group that includes eight other species besides Scinax faivovichi: Scinax alcatraz, Scinax atratus, Scinax arduous, Scinax littoreus, Scinax melloi, Scinax perpusillus, Scinax v-signatus,  and Scinax peixotoi (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

 The species was named after Julian Faivovich, whom made major contributions to the systematic of the frog family Hylidae, including the genus Scinax (Brasileiro et al. 2007).

This is the largest tree frog native to the United States (Bartlett 1999). It is also the largest species in the genus (Duellman 1970). 
 
Males are about 76 mm and females reach a maximum of 90 mm. Chubby, stocky and short-legged (Savage 2002). 
 
Broad, flat head, indistinct from body. It is distinguished from other species by having a row of warts along the lower arm. Snout is rounded in dorsal view and bluntly truncate in lateral view. Large prominent eyes with horizontally ellipted pupils, and gold or silver irises. Distinct tympanum with a diameter about two-thirds of the eye. Dorsal skin is smooth and venter skin is granular (Lee 2000). 
  
Varies in color and pattern. The upper surface of S. baudinii can be a shade of green, tan or brown with a pattern of dark patches. Metachrosis is extreme and individuals can change colors depending on circumstances (although individuals tend to retain their dark blotches usually outlined by black) (Savage 2002). 
 The vocal sac of breeding males is grey (Leenders 2001). 
 Males have dark throats and females have light throats (Bartlett 1999). 
 
 The undersurfaces are white to creamy yellow, usually devoid of markings (Lee 2000). 
 A dark streak extends from the eye onto the shoulder region. There is also a vertical black bar that lies on the upper lip directly below the eye (Norman 1998). 
 
Similar to S. phaeota, the dorsal surface of the hind limbs have dark transverse bars (Leenders 2001). 
 Has contrasting yellow and black mottling on the back of the thighs and especially in groin region (Norman 1998). 
 Moderately large appendages. Toes are extensively webbed. Fingers are extensively webbed at bases (Savage 2002). 

","
Humid, subhumid and semiarid lowlands and marginally on premontane slopes from southern Sonora, Mexico, and extreme southeastern Texas to southeastern and southwestern Costa Rica (Savage 2002). 
Probably more common in urban backyards with pools than in the wild. Occurs in the vicinity of canals, resacas, ponds, pools and other water retaining areas. In dry years these frogs are difficult to find (Bartlett 1999).
","
Nocturnal and aboreal frog. Uses shallow temporary bodies of water as breeding sites (Savage 2002). 

During dry seasons S. baudinii seeks refuge in tree holes, outer sheaths of banana plants, or under bark. When attacked by a predator, both sexes emit high-pitched distress calls with their mouths wide open (Savage 2002). 
 
Usually breeds from June to October but in the more humid Caribbean lowlands, this frog appears to have a longer breeding season. (Duellman 1970). Males will usually call from the edge of water areas. Amplexus is axillary and takes place in the shallow waters. Females lay 2,500-3,500 eggs in a surface film. The eggs are black and cream in color and are 1.3 mm in diameter (1.5 mm including the vitelline membrane). Metamorphosis takes place 14-20 days after fertilization. Metamorphs are 12-15.5 mm in standard length (Savage 2002). 

Their mating call consists of a series of short, explosive ""wonk-wonk-wonk"" notes. Call groups are spaced 15 seconds to several minutes apart. On average notes last 0.11 seconds. The two frequencies emphasized are from 350Hz and 2500Hz. S.baudinii call in duets (Duellman 1970). 

One of a handful of frogs known to create cocoons of parchment like wrappings that cover themselves as a protective means to estivate during drought or dry seasons. (McDiarmid and Foster 1987). 
","

","
Although S. Baudinii seems to be able to adapt well to human impact, it is possible that development has reduced populations. Some historical peripheral populations have not been seen in a decade or more. This is a protected species by the state of Texas (Bartlett 1999).

","
Smilisca fodiens is a frog that can reach sizes of 54 - 63 mm. Females do not differ significantly from males in proportions. The relatively small head is slightly wider than long. The skin of the head is partly co-ossified with underlying cranial bones. The snout when dorsally viewed is acutely rounded and bluntly rounded from the lateral view. The canthal ridges are distinct, where they meet forms a bony internasal ridge. The ridge extends anteriorly to the tip of the snout. The pupil is horizontal and the iris is dull bronze. The hind limbs are short and robust. The fingers are long and have small discs. The fingers are slender and have no webbing. The toes have small amount of webbing. The terminal discs are smaller than the finger discs. The inner metatarsal tubercle is large, elliptical, and spade-like. The skin is granular on the belly, dorsum, and parts of the thighs but otherwise smooth. The vocal sac is subgular and bilobate, and the halves are narrowly separated. The tadpoles have short tails, are pelagic type, have a anteroventral mouth with a large beak, have large papillae both laterally and ventrally, and have two-thirds tooth rows (Trueb 1969).

Smilisca fodiens's closest relative is Smilisca dentata, from which it can be differentiated by S. fodiens having a bony ridge extending from a point between the nostrils to the tip of the acutely rounded snout, digits expanded into small discs, and vocal sacs connected medially in breeding males (Trueb 1969).

In life, the dorsum coloration ranges from tan, pale olive-brown, grey-brown, and pink-brown. There are longitudinal stripes and small spots with dark brown or red-brown coloration and dark brown or black outline. In preservative, the dorsal ground color varies from pale grey-tan to creamy/pink-tan (Trueb 1969).

There is variation in the pattern of stripe/spot arrangement, as well as slight coloration differences (Trueb 1969).
","
Smilisca fodiens occurs from south-central Arizona in the USA, southward along the Pacific coast through to western Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit and Colima in Mexico. Inland it is found from central Jalisco to northern MichoacÃ¡n and adjacent Guanajuato, Mexico. It occurs from near sea level to about 1,490m (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).

In Arizona, S. fodiens lives in burrows in open mesquite grassland. In Mexico it is also found in tropical scrub forests (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).

Fieldwork in several localities along S. fodiensâ€™s range has recorded well-preserved populations, especially those occurring in Biosphere Reserves. Based on the map in Trueb (1969), there appear to be many populations, particularly in the southern part of its range (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).

","
Smilisca fodiens is a terrestrial burrowing species, adapted to living in burrows where humidity is high (Ford and Finch 1994), and lives in xeric environments. It is common in temporary pools formed by rains where it also breeds (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010). The frogs time the onset of breeding with the summer rains from July through August (Ford and Finch 1994). These frogs aestivate by forming cocoons underground (Lannoo 2005).

The call of S. fodiens sounds like a duck quack, as it consists of a series of low-pitched notes (Trueb 1969).

","

","
While the population trend is stable, S. fodiens is threatened by agricultural development in some parts of its range, especially within its wide Mexican range. The species can, however, be found in several protected areas  (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).
","

","
Modifications such as short, robust limbs, squat body, and heavily ossified head allow the frog to live a fossorial existence. The internasal and labial flanges of the frog are adaptations for phragmotic behavior (Trube 1969). Phragmosis involves the frogs using the bony skull to plug the burrow against predators, wind, and loss of moisture (Ford and Finch 1994).

Smilisca fodiens was previously within the genus Pternohyla, which was recently synonymized with Smilisca (Faivovich et al. 2005).

The species epithet, fodiens, comes from the Latin word fodio, meaning to dig; this refers to the digging adaptations of the spade-like inner metatarsal tubercles (Trueb 1969).

","
Smilisca phaeota is a relatively large hylid frog with adult size reaching up to 78 mm (Leenders 2001).  This frog can be easily be distinguished, since it is the only large tree frog in Costa Rica that has both a silvery white stripe on the upper lip and a dark, masklike stripe from the nostril to the insertion of the arms (Guyer 2005).  Many individuals have a green spot on each side of the head between the dark mask and the lip (Leenders 2001).  Coloration can range from pale green to tan, and the frog may either be uniform in color or have dark olive green to dark brown dorsal blotches (Savage 2002).  It has a relatively flattened body (Leenders 2001), and a smooth dorsal surface (Savage 2002).  The head is as wide as it is long, with a snout that is bluntly rounded from above (Savage 2002).  It has skinlike webbing between the toes and fingers and an enlarged disk on each finger that is adhesive.  The eardrums (tympana) are visible.  The eyes are large, with horizontal elliptical pupils and copper colored irises (Leenders 2001).  
 
Smilisca phaeota is capable of changing color.  It can change the color of its upper surface to tan or green.  They are usually tan during the day and change to green during the night (Leenders 2001). 

Similar species include: 1) Smilisca baudinii, which differs from S. phaeota by the former's lack of reticulate flanks and white stripes on the lip, forearm, and leg;  2)Smilisca puma, which is smaller and has little or no webbing (Savage 2002).
","
Smilisca phaeota can be found in the Caribbean slopes from Honduras to northern Colombia and the Pacific slopes from Costa Rica to Ecuador (Guyer 2005).  It primarily inhabits lowland rainforest, up to 3,300 ft in elevation (Leenders 2001).  It is common in areas disturbed by humans, such as storm drains and around laboratory buildings (Guyer 2005).
","
These frogs are mainly active during the night and throughout the wet season (Savage 2002).  During the day, they sleep on the upper surface of large leaves, but have also been found sleeping on top of large tree ferns or in rolled-up banana leaves.  In the mating season, males produce a loud and harsh ""wrauk"" at dusk.  They call from the water surface of small rain pools.  Females lay small clumps of up to 2,000 eggs to form a small thin layer on the water surface.  Since females lay their eggs in small rain pools, tadpoles must develop rapidly to avoid desiccation (Leenders 2001).   

This frog presumably preys on arthropods (Guyer 2005).  

","
Tadpoles are moderately sized and can reach 30 mm in length.  They have a robust body, anteroventral mouth, dorsolateral nostrils, dorsolateral eyes, lateral spiracle, and a rounded tail tip (Savage 2002).

These frogs are common (Savage 2002).

Smilisca puma is a moderate-sized golden-tan tree frog (32 to 38 mm adult male SVL, 40 to 46 mm adult female SVL) that has a white labial stripe, a white forearm stripe, a white tarsal stripe along the outer margin of the tibial segment of the leg, and lacks finger webbing. The dorsal pattern consists of paired elongate dark brown to green blotches which branch out across the midline at one or several points. A broad, irregular dark brown to dark green stripe extends posteriorly from each eye and eventually becomes either an H-shaped mark or breaks into spots. Anterior flank has fine dark lines. Inguinal region is white with dark mottling. The posterior thigh surfaces are dark brown. The venter is creamy white. The iris is deep bronze (Savage 2002).

The dorsal surface is smooth. The head is slightly longer than broad with a rounded snout in profile, small eyes, and a distinct tympanum which has a diameter one-half to seven-tenths of the eye diameter. Fingers are short and stout with moderately expanded discs and lack webbing. Toes are weakly webbed. Adult males have paired vocal slits and fully distensible paired grayish brown external subgular vocal sacs. Breeding males also have a light brown nuptial pad on the base of each thumb (Savage 2002).

Larvae are moderately sized, up to 24 mm at stage 34. Body shape is ovoid, mouth is anteroventral, nostrils and eyes are dorsolateral, the tail is short, and the tail tip is rounded. Spiracle is lateral and sinistral, while the vent tube is dextral. Oral disc is small and entire with serrated beaks, 2/3 denticle rows (gap in A2). Single row of papillae on upper labium, two on lower labium, wide gap above mouth, and many additional papillae at angle of jaws. Larval dorsum is olive brown with greenish tan flecks; tail fins are pale brown with greenish gold flecks. Dark markings on tail musculature and anterior fin bases with dark flecks on the posterior fin bases. Iris is bronze (Savage 2002).
","
Smilisca puma is found in humid Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica and adjacent Nicaragua (15-520 m asl). It occurs in relatively undisturbed Atlantic Lowland Moist and Wet Forests (Savage 2002).
","
Smilisca puma are rarely seen nocturnal treefrogs (Savage 2002). They are usually only found in close proximity to their breeding sites (generally small, shallow temporary pools or ponds within the forest but sometimes more open areas) (Savage 2002; Duellman 1967). Males call in small choruses (2-4 males) during the rainy season (February through September) from shallow water and low bushes, while hidden in the vegetation (Savage 2002). Each frog alternates calls with nearby neighbors (Savage 2002). The call sounds like a low squawk, lasting 60-350 msec, and is usually followed by one or more secondary rattling notes lasting 100-470 msec, with dominant frequencies of about 0.74 and 1.897 kHz (Duellman 1970). Although calling takes place throughout the rainy season, breeding itself is restricted to periods of heavy rain from June through August (Savage 2002). 

Tadpoles are benthic. Newly metamorphosed froglets are 12.5 mm SVL (Savage 2002).
","

","
Smilisca puma is classified as Least Concern due to its wide distribution and presumed large population. However, habitat loss and degradation due to small and large-scale agriculture and logging represent major threats. The forests of south-eastern Nicaragua have been less altered than those in adjacent Costa Rica. This species does occur in a number of protected areas and can tolerate disturbed habitat (BolaÃ±os et al. 2004).

Sphaenorhynchus lacteus is a relatively large Sphaenorhynchus (Lime Treefrog) found in South America. Snout-vent length is 25.5-41.5 mm in males, 38.4-45.7 mm in females (Duellman 2005). The skin is smooth dorsally, granular ventrally. The snout is pointed when viewed from above, and angles sharply back when viewed laterally. The pupil is horizontally elliptical (BenÃ­cio et al. 2011). A dark canthal stripe often runs from the anterior corner of the eyes to the tip of the snout. The vomerine teeth are arranged in oval patches between the rear portions of the choanae. The tympana are exposed, and a tarsal fold is present. Fingers are approximately two-thirds webbed, while toes are completely webbed (Rivero 1969).

Sphaenorhynchus lacteus can be distinguished from other Sphaenorhynchus species by its large size, well-defined canthal stripe, more extensive webbing of the digits, and lack of a dorsolateral stripe (Rivero 1969).

In life the dorsum of S. lacteus is green. The canthal stripe is dark brown. The eyes are a creamy bronze color. White ventrally, and along the outer margins of the limbs. The limbs are a bluish green viewed from below (BenÃ­cio et al. 2011).

Males tend to be smaller than females. The appearance of the canthal stripe may vary. Amount of webbing and disc size also may vary between individuals or across populations (Rivero 1969). Males have nuptial pads on the thumbs and a large, median, subgular vocal sac (BenÃ­cio et al. 2011). 

Sphaenorhynchus lacteus tadpoles are oval in shape with blunt snouts. Body length in stage 25 tadpoles is 4.1-7.2 mm, with a total length of 12-14.3 mm. At stage 42, one individual had a body length of 24.1 mm and a total length of 54.6 mm. Eyes are large and directed to the side. Oral disk is small. The musculature of the tail is moderately robust. At its maximum height, the tail fin is half the height of the caudal musculature (Duellman 2005).
	
Tadpoles are dark purple dorsally with silver or gold mottling on the sides. The iris is yellow. The chin is grey with flecking, while the belly is purple. The tail has purple stripes. In preservative, tadpoles appear brown and grey (Duellman 2005).

","
Sphaenorhynchus lacteus is found in the Orinoco basin of Venezuela; the Amazon basin of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela; Trinidad and Tobago; the Guianas (French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname); and the seasonally flooded lowlands of MaranhÃ£o, Brazil. It is found at elevations between sea level and 300 meters (La Marca et al. 2010). 

Sphaenorhynchus lacteus inhabits wetland, tropical forest, forest edge, savannah, meadow, and pond habitats. It can also be found in agricultural areas with seasonal flooding (La Marca et al. 2010). 
","
Sphaenorhynchus lacteus is semi-aquatic; individuals are typically found in vegetation 0.5 to 2 meters off the ground, usually over the water. Sphaenorhynchus lacteus is an aquatic breeder. Individuals congregate around ponds at night. Males call from emergent grasses as well as from floating vegetation (La Marca et al. 2010). 
Their call consists of  clacking notes 0.10-0.12 seconds in duration with occasional longer pulsed notes 0.3 seconds long. The dominant frequency of the calls is 2240 Hz.  After breeding, eggs are deposited in clutches of around 60 in the water or on the leaves of floating plants (Duellman 2005).

Sphaenorhynchus lacteus feeds primarily on ants (Duellman 2005).
","

","
Though populations are stable and the species is relatively common throughout its range, S. lacteus populations in certain areas may be threatened by fire, clear cutting, and water pollution (La Marca et al. 2010). 

Some populations exist within protected areas in Venezuela and Ecuador (La Marca et al. 2010). 

","
The species can be found in the pet trade and is mentioned on herpetoculture forums under the names â€œGreater Hatchet-faced treefrogâ€ and â€œOrinoco Lime Treefrog.â€
","
 The species authority for S. lacteus is FranÃ§ois Marie Daudin, 1803. The species was first described as both Hyla lactea and H. aurantiaca by Daudin. (Note: A â€œHyla lacteaâ€ had been previously described by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti in 1768. This species, however, had a large mouth, milky white spots, and barred flanks. This was not the same species as Daudinâ€™s Hyla lactea, and thus is not the same species as S. lacteus).  Hyla lactea and H. aurantiaca were then shown to be a single species in 1969 by Juan A. Rivero, who renamed the species Sphaenorhynchus eurhostus. An analysis of nomenclature by William E. Duellman and John D. Lynch in 1981 found that the species would most accurately be called Sphaenorhynchus lacteus (Duellman and Lynch 1981).

Its common name in Spanish is ""Rana Fantasma"" (La Marca et al. 2010), which translates to ""Ghost Frog.""

Diagnosis:Tlalocohyla loquax is a light gray or yellow to tan treefrog with a robust, medium-sized body (33-35 mm SVL in males, 38-47 mm in females) that can be distinguished by its yellow venter and bright red axilla, groin, anterior and posterior thighs, and webs (Savage 2002). 

Description: Tlalocohyla loquax are medium-sized tree frogs, with adult males 33 to 45 mm in total length and adult females 38 to 47 mm, characterized by having a yellow venter and bright red or orange coloration on the backside of the thighs and on the webbing between the fingers and toes.     The upper surface is smooth, while the venter is granular.  The head is typically wider than long; the snout looks bluntly round from above and in profile.  The eyes are large; and the tympanum is distinct as well.  The diameter of the tympanum is 1/2 to 2/3 the diameter of the eyes in males, and slightly less in females (less than 1/2).  Fingers are short and robust.  All fingers are moderately webbed, but no nuptial thumb pads were observed in males (Gaige and Stuart 1934; Savage 2002). 

At night, the dorsal surfaces are typically yellow to reddish brown.  During the day, the upper surface is yellow to pale gray, almost white.  Often some small dark brown mottling flecks are seen.  Most notably, webs and concealed surfaces are bright red, the venter is lemon yellow, and the iris reddish tan. The only other Costa Rican tree frog with red webbing on hands and feet is Hypsiboas rufitelus, which does not have a yellow venter. (Savage 2002). 

At stage 25, the tadpole measures 45 mm in total length.  The body is ovoid. The tail is moderate and acuminate, with high caudal fins and a pointed tail tip. Eyes and nostrils are directed dorsolaterally, with mouth anteroventral. The oral disc is small and complete and has moderate, finely serrated beaks, 2/3 rows of denticles (A2 with a wide medial gap, P2 with a narrow gap, P3 extremely short), two rows of papillae around the edges of the disc except for above the mouth, and additional papillae at the level of the jaw angle. The spiracle is lateral and sinistral;  The vent tube is dextral. The body is light in color with dark spots between the eyes and a distinct V-shaped dark mark on the snout pointing towards spots between the eyes.  The venter is metallic silver or copper and the fins are mottled with dark gray pigments.  The iris is orange (Savage 2002).  
","
This species is found in humid lowlands and premontane slopes of the Atlantic versant from southern Veracruz, Mexico, to south-central eastern Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, it is found exclusively in the northeast, at elevations below 1,000 m (3,300 ft) (Leenders 2001).  

Their habitat is typically around temporary ponds in Lowland Moist and Wet Forest zones and marginally in Premontane Wet Forest and Rainforest (Savage 2002). 
","
This frog makes a series of â€œkaaackâ€ or â€œwonkâ€ notes that resemble the honking of geese.  These notes repeat at intervals of 900 milliseconds to 5 seconds and last 50 to 160 milliseconds, with a repetition rate of 9 to 62 per minute.  Its call is poorly modulated, with a dominant frequency ranging between 2.1 to 2.4 Hz (Savage 2002).  

Tlalocohyla loquax is a relatively uncommon nocturnal species that primarily breeds in deep bodies of standing water (both permanent and temporary).  Males call throughout the wet season with a loud ""kaaack"" from floating leaves in the deepest parts of the breeding ponds.  Although this species is not an explosive breeder, its reproduction peaks in July and early August, in mid-rainy season.  Each clutch contains about 250 eggs, and forms a large gelatinous mass that is attached to vegetation near the water surface.  Tadpoles are nektonic and live away from the shore in the deepest parts of the breeding pond (Savage 2002).  
","

","
This species is adaptable and can persist in disturbed habitats if there is deep water and at least some vegetation available.  It occurs in many protected areas (Santos-Barrera et al. 2008).

Trachycephalus coriaceus (previously Phrynohyas coriacea) is a relatively large tree frog. In the lowland rainforest of southeastern Peru, Duellman (2005) reported a snout-vent-length ranging from 52.0 - 59.5 mm for males (with an average of 55.73 +/- 2.33 mm) and 52.9 - 64.8 mm for females (with an average of 58.55 +/- 3.39 mm). The head is broad, roughly the same width as the body, and the snout is short and round on both dorsal view and profile. The tympanum is Â¾ the size of the eye and the thick supratympanic fold covers its upper edge. The dorsal skin is smooth, glandular, and thick. The ventral skin is areolate. Fingers and toes have round terminal discs and are relatively short. Fingers are Â½ webbed while toes are Â¾ webbed. Males have dark brown nuptial excrescences and paired lateral vocal sacks can be found posterior to the tympanum. Trachycephalus coriaceus tadpoles have an elongated, elliptical body that is widest just posterior to the eyes and throughout the midlength. The snout is round in dorsal view. When viewed in profile, the snout rounds off to a blunt tip anteroventrally. The eyes are positioned laterally. Infraorbital and supraorbital neuromast rows are conspicuous. The spiracle is on the left side of the body, and is completely attached to the body wall. The vent tube is dextral, just below the ventral fin. The caudal musculature is the same height throughout the anterior one-third of the tail length and tapers off into a thin tip towards the end. At the beginning of metamorphosis, the color of the limbs and the dorsum of the body are a pale green while the venter is a creamy white. The iris is a light orange. Metamorph individuals have brown dorsum with darker brown patterns (Duellman, 2005).

This species bears lateral vocal sacs and red webbing.  There are only two other treefrogs found in Madre de Dios that have red webbing: Hyla geographica (now Hypsiboas geographicus; Claudia Azevedo-Ramos et al. 2010) and Hyla triangulum.  Both of these species only overlap with a fraction of T. coriaecus' range. Hypsiboas geographicus has reticulated lower eyelids and calcars on the heels while H. triangulum is far smaller and has thin dorsal skin that differ the two species from T. coriaceus (Duellman 2005). 

In life, the dorsum and flanks of the female are mostly composed of shades of brown, including reddish brown and grayish tan. In some individuals, the dorsum can have distinct, peculiar patterning: a large, brown rectangular shaped blotch that extends from the upper eyelids to the lower sacral region. and another smaller, horizontal, rectangular blotch below the sacrum. These dorsal markings are enclosed by narrow black and pale cream outlines. A black spot can be found posterior to the tympanum and below the supratympanic fold. The ventral surfaces of the shanks, the webbing of hands and feet, the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, and inner surfaces of the feet are all red. The throat, belly, and sides are creamy yellow. The eyes are pale-orange with a metallic luster. When preserved, the dorsal markings may or may not be present. The species appears washed away, with the dorsal side being a homogenous brown and the ventral a dull tan or cream (Duellman 2005).

Tadpole body coloration changes from black to a dull brown during tadpole development. Specifically, both the dorsal and the sides of the body are colored dark brown to black while the ventral side is a contrasting silvery white. The caudal musculature is the same color as the dorsal side with two pale, broad lines running down the side, narrowing and converging distally. The fins are light grey. After preservation, the body becomes tan. There is an area above the snout that is a diffused brown. Posterior to the orbit is a brown blotch while below the orbit is a brown crescent-shape spot. The fins are translucent. The dorsal and ventral sides of the caudal musculature are dark brown while the rest of the caudal musculature is a creamy tan (Duellman 2005).
  
","
Trachycephalus coriaceus is found in the Madre de Dios region in Peru, bordering Brazil and Bolivia.  It is also found in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname. Individuals are mainly found inhabiting inundated (flooded) forests, but may also be found in camp clearings and terra firma (â€œsolid earthâ€ or un-flooded) forest (Angulo et al. 2010). 
","
This species is arboreal and nocturnal, and has a sit-and-wait foraging strategy (Duellman 2005). This species has been known to exhibit a defensive behavior that involves inflating itself to appear larger than it really is. This larger size may also make the individual more difficult to consume. In addition, this inflation emphasizes the two black spots on the flanks, posterior to the tympanum by making them visible from the front.  However, these two defensive mechanisms, the puffing up of the body and the flash coloration, have not been observed as a response to a predator confrontation, but only seen when the individual is handled by a human (De la Riva 1994).

Most individuals congregate at permanent and temporary pools for breeding. During the breeding season, males exhibit a loud growl as an advertisement call while floating on the water and fully inflated. When inflated the paired lateral vocal sacs of the male inflate upward and over the head, nearly touching. Females oviposit eggs in a surface film on the water (Duellman 2005).
","

","
The species as a whole is probably not threatened. However, it is likely that local populations are threatened by deforestation (Angulo et al. 2010).
","
Cashinahua Indians (Balta, Departamento Ucayali) and the Achuar Indians in Ecuador are known to consume this species. Additional research is required in order to determine if this species is exploited as a source of protein in other locations (Angulo et al. 2010).
","
There has been a recent taxonomic change for this species: it was previously known as Phrynohyas coriacea (Angulo et al. 2010).

Males 77 mm, females 
88 mm. The dorsum is dark brown 
with large khaki-green to light brown 
spots. The legs, arms and fingers have 
darker brown bars with cream borders. 
The snout is rounded. There is a large 
khaki-green triangle between the eyes 
pointing in the direction of the snout. 
The dorsum has large tubercles. The 
iris is golden with a black Maltese cross 
centered on the pupil. There is a vocal

","
In Brazil, this species occurs throughout the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke. Lima et al. (2005)
It is primarily found in primary forest. It will occupy this canopy unless it descends to a calling site, a large water-filled tree holes. (Hodl 1991)
","
The species is arboreal 
and nocturnal. Males call only from 
water filled tree holes, at heights 
between 2 and 32 m. Calling seems to only occur during rainless, cloudless nights. Calls can travel long distances through the use of the rain forest low-frequency sound window. Lima et al.(2005)
Reproduction 
occurs mainly in the rainy season 
between November and May. Clutches 
of about 2500 eggs form a gelatinous 
mass that floats near the surface of 
water or adheres to the inner wall of 
the tree holes. Tadpoles develop until 
metamorphosis in the tree holes. 
Tadpoles have dark brown dorsums and 
light colored bellies. They feed on 
conspecific eggs and vegetable detritus. Lima et al.(2005)
A typical call by T. resinifictrix consists of three notes similar in spectral composition. The notes have clear harmonic structures with sound energy distribution over a wide range of frequencies. At the first note of the call, there is a maximum intensity at the sixth harmonic (1300 Hz) and also increased intensities at the fourth (867) and fifths (1083) as well. The first harmonic is 216.6 Hz. Calls were separated by approximately 15.8 s and consisted of a series of 1 to 6 notes. The variable call rate was highest at the beginning of the night, and lowest at the end of the night. The mean duration of a note was 307 ms and the mean internote interval lasted 633 ms.

Trachycephalus venulosus is a large frog, with adult males 70 to 101 mm and adult females 93 to 114 mm in snout-vent length. The head is wider than long, with a round and blunt snout and medium-sized eyes. The tympanum is distinct and rather large, having a diameter 50 to 80% of the diameter of the eyes, and is larger in females than males. The body is robust. The dorsal skin is thick and glandular, with the highest concentration of glands near the back and sides of the head.  Dorsal skin texture is strongly tuberculate in juveniles and may be tuberculate or smooth in adults.  Ventrally, the skin is quite areolate on the throat, venter, and posteroventral area of the thighs. Fingers are short and robust and have large expanded finger discs, with the third finger disc being larger than the tympanum. Fingers are moderately webbed, while the toes have a large amount of webbing. The hand has an enlarged thenar tubercle pad and a bifid distal subarticular tubercle underneath the fourth finger; the palmar tubercle is lacking.  The foot has an ovoid, average-sized inner metatarsal tubercle, a small, conical outer metatarsal tubercle and a very clear tarsal fold.  Males have paired, lateral, expandable vocal sacs (unique among Costa Rican hylids), located behind the angles of the jaw when not inflated. Males also have a tan nuptial pad, lacking spines, on the base of the thumb. Bones are green, as in other frogs of the genus Trachycephalus, distinguishing this genus from other hylids (Savage 2002; this genus was formerly named Phrynohyas). Green bones are also present in centrolenid frogs. 

This species can be distinguished from other treefrogs by its uniformly colored flanks and green bones, and the lack of dark vertical barring on the lip; additionally, males can be distinguished by the paired lateral vocal sacs, one on either side of the head behind the angle of the jaw (Savage 2002).

Dorsally, the frog is yellowish tan, tan, reddish brown, or pale gray in color. The ventral surface may be dirty light brown to cream. Adults typically have a large, dark olive tan to brown mark on the back that takes up almost the whole dorsal surface. Occasionally light spots are present on the dorsum, broken by transverse bands of the body color. Limbs tend to have transverse dark bars on the upper surfaces, though some individuals lack barring. Vocal sacs are pale or olive brown when inflated, but look dark brown or black when deflated. Irises are golden bronze with tiny splotches of black (Savage 2002).

Tadpoles of Trachycephalus venulosus are large, with a robust body measuring 41 mm in total length (Savage 2002). The tadpoles have a pond type body form with a forward facing mouth (anteroventral), eyes that are facing laterally and deep, high fins tapering to the end of the pointed tail (Zweifel 1964). Nostrils are anterolateral. The spiracle is lateral and on the left (sinistral) and the vent tube is medial (located in the middle of the body;  Savage 2002). The younger tadpoles have complete beaks that gradually become poorly developed as the tadpole grows larger (Zweifel 1964). Oral discs are very small compared to the body, with the diameter being only about 44% of the body, and the edges are able to fold up make a shape like a triangle which closes the mouth (Zweifel 1964). Papillae are present, but not above the mouth, being located laterally and ventrally with the lowest row or two fragmented (Savage 2002). Beaks are finely serrated (Savage 2002). Tooth rows in the tadpoles may be 3-4 rows on the top and 4-6 rows on the bottom (Zweifel 1964; Savage 2002). Zweifel (1964) described a large space in the first row of upper denticles, and many spaces in the lower denticle rows (Zweifel 1964). Savage's (2002) description mentions A1 and A2 being present only laterally, and usually fragmented, with a slight median gap in the row just above the mouth (A2 or A3), and sometimes the row just below (P1) also with a narrow median gap. This tooth formula varies greatly from the typical Hyla larvae that have a 2/3 tooth row, and those species with more tooth rows do not have the gaps that T. venulosus has (Zweifel 1964).

Tadpoles have a brown dorsum and a creamy tan ventral surface with small brown splotches. The body has a brown stripe down the body lengthwise. Fins have small dark flecks of coloration and developed legs have a lengthwise dark stripe. The iris is a pale brown (Savage 2002). 

","
This species has a wide range in Central and northern South America. It lives in lowland forests which may be dry, moist, or wet, at an elevation of 2-285 m (Savage 2002).

","
This is a nocturnal frog typically found perching on tree branches and vegetation while foraging at night. It shelters in bromeliads, tree holes, under tree bark of both living and dead trees, or in banana or heliconia sheaths during the dry season. During the rainy season, which is also the breeding season, these frogs are found near temporary ponds (Savage 2002).

Males call from the breeding site, while floating in the shallow water, their inflated lateral vocal sacs noticeable on either side of the head (Savage 2002). The advertisement call is described as a loud growl, repeated at regular, short intervals. Notes are repeated 42 to 69 times per minute with each note lasting between 230 and 400 ms (Savage 2002). The dominant frequency is from 1.39 to 2.5 kHz, and the call has 12 to 14 harmonics (Duellman 1970; Lee 1996). Males can be heard calling in groups of 5-10, or rarely in larger groups of 20-40 (Gottsberger and Gruber 2004). Most calls occur during the first night of explosive breeding (Gottsberger and Gruber 2004).

Trachycephalus venulosus also has a distinct distress call. The call starts with a 'squeaklike' sound that probably comes from constricted airways, followed by three bursts of sound lasting between .29 and .38 seconds (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998). Analysis of a recorded call shows that the sound bursts were separated by intervals of 1.405 and 3.014 seconds (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998). The first two sound bursts had a fundamental frequency of 260 Hz with a dominant frequency of 3.27 to 5.67 kHz while the third had a higher dominant frequency of 4.75 and 7.08 kHz (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998). After the distress call, many frogs were observed coming out of hiding in trees and going towards the calling frog; shortly after the frog escaped, the responding frogs returned to their hiding places (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998).

Breeding is explosive after heavy rains (Savage 2002). After amplexus occurs in the water, females lay eggs as a film on the water surface, with the film covering a total of 1.5 square meters (Zweifel 1964). Eggs were recorded to be developing at temperatures ranging from 27 to 33 degrees Celsius (Zweifel 1964). The eggs, which have a diameter of 3.5 mm, hatch after one day into free-living tadpoles at stage 18, with a length of 3.8 to 4.4 mm (Savage 2002). Metamorphosis into an adult takes between 37 to 47 days (Zweifel 1964; Pyburn 1967). Some aspects of larval coloration are retained initially, such as a dark leg stripe and green bones, but are quickly lost within a few days and replaced by the full adult coloration (Savage 2002).

The tadpoles have very large gills, most likely as an adaptation to living in warm water with a low oxygen level (Zweifel 1964). Tadpoles have been observed to spread out the gills at the surface of the water (Zweifel 1964). Combined with the large lungs, these tadpoles are well suited for life in small ponds (Zweifel 1964). The larvae feed by scraping surfaces underneath the water (Savage 2002). In the wild, tadpoles consume planktonic algae (Rossa-Feres et al. 2004). In the laboratory, tadpoles were fed successfully with canned spinach and sometimes boiled lettuce (Zweifel 1964). 

Adults of this species have granular glands in the skin, concentrated in the dorsal pustules and in the interorbital, occipital, supratympanic, and anterior dorsal areas (McDiarmid 1968). These glands can secrete a large amount of sticky white, volatile, poisonous, alkaline, water-insoluble mucus, when the frog is handled (Savage 2002). The glands along the side of the neck look normal during the wet season (from late June onwards), but in the dry season (February and March) they become greatly enlarged and can cover most of the tympanum (McDiarmid 1968). The mucus deters predators; in one documented case, a frog released a large amount of milky white mucus on an attacking snake's head, causing the snake to release the frog because it was so covered in the thick mucus it could not close its mouth or see (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998).  The mucus is also sticky and water-insoluble, so frogs may make use of it to combat desiccation during the dry season by reducing water loss through the skin (Savage 2002). Some may even line tree holes with the secretion to help keep moist, as is the case for South American members of this genus (Savage 2002; Veillardi 1948).

These frogs also have a highly developed ability to parachute from trees (Cott 1926). One was observed gliding for 27 m, after being dropped from a height of 43 m (Cott 1926). The frog was not simply falling, because it consistently descended with the back facing upwards and the legs spread out laterally (Oliver 1951).
","

","
Currently, this species is listed as Least Concern (IUCN 2006). In one study, no individuals of Trachycephalus venulosus were found over a 3 year period, but since the previous study had only found 3, it is not necessarily declining (Eterovick et al. 2005).  More likely it has always been present in very low numbers in that area of Brazil (Eterovick et al. 2005). Furthermore, this species is very widespread in Central and South America, so the populations there are most likely not in any danger of declines (IUCN 2006).
","
This frog produces sticky, insoluble, noxious secretions that cause severe reactions, ranging from irritation, swelling, and pain to temporary blindness if the secretions end up in the eyes or on any mucous membrane (Savage 2002). It is called the 'pepper treefrog' in Belize because it is thought to cause sneezing (Meyer and Foster 1996).

","
This species was treated as Phrynohyas venulosa in Savage (2002).  

The karyotype is 2N = 24; all chromosomes are metacentric or subtelocentric (Bogart 1973).

","
Triprion petasatus is a frog with a snout-vent length of 48.1 mm to 60.8 mm in males and 65.0 mm to 75.2 mm in females.  Its head is large and in the form of a bony casque, with skin completely attached (co-ossified) to the skull.  It has an large, expanded, upturned prenasal bone (distinguishing it from all other Middle American casque-headed hylids) and expanded maxillaries, which together form a broad, labial shelf with a serrate edge.  The snout protrudes far beyond the leading edge of the lower jaw.  Nostrils are dorsal, located at about two thirds of the distance from the eye to the tip of the snout.  At the anterior edge of the eye, there is a bony, preorbital knob, which is sometimes so enlarged that it hangs over the eye's anterior edge.  A sharp canthal ridge extends from this preorbital knob to a point just posterior to the nostril.  The eyes are large, protuberant, and directed anterolaterally.  There is a bony, supratympanic ridge extending from the posterior edge of the eye to the posterior edge of the skull.  This ridge hangs over the upper edge of the tympanum, which would otherwise be distinct. There is also a finely serrate bony ridge, generally with a medial notch, delimiting the posterior edge of the skull (Duellman 2001).   

The upper arms are slender, while the forearms are robust.  The wrist has a transverse dermal fold.  The fingers are moderately long and robust, with greatly expanded discs; the diameter of the third finger disc approximately equals the diameter of the tympanum.  Both suberarticular tubercles and supernumerary tubercles are large and round.  This frog also has a large, flat, palmar tubercle.  Males possess nuptial pads, which extend along the inner edge of the thumb to the disc.  Webbing is lacking between fingers 1 and 2 and is rudimentary thereafter.  The hind legs are short when adpressed, with the heels barely overlapping.  There is a well-defined tarsal fold extending along the full length of the tarsus.  The inner metatarsal tubercle is large, flat, and elliptical, while the outer metatarsal tubercle is minute and round.  The toes are long, about 2/3 webbed, and have discs slightly smaller than those on the fingers.  On the feet, the subarticular tubercles are round and somewhat larger than the supernumerary tubercles.  The frog has smooth skin on its dorsum (except its head), chin, and ventral surfaces of its limbs (except its thighs).  The skin is granular on the flanks and belly (Duellman 2001).  

Males are generally an olive green while females are tan or sometimes olive-brown, with dark brown or black markings on the back, shanks, and forearms, but not the head.  In some individuals there are silvery gray flecks on the dorsum, especially the head.  Flanks are olive-green or yellow-green. Dark brown or black transverse bands are usually present on thighs and feet but may be lacking in some specimens.  The posterior surfaces of the thighs are dark brown or reddish brown, and the anterior surfaces are pale brown. The frog has a white belly and tan ventral surfaces on the shanks and feet.  It has a golden bronze iris with black reticulations. Breeding males have yellow vocal sacs with brown flecks, as well as nuptial pads (Duellman 2001).

Tadpoles have been measured at 12.3 mm body length and 27.0 mm total length at stage 30.  The tadpole has an ovoid body, which is slightly wider than it is deep.  Its tail is moderately deep, and pointed terminally.  Its snout is bluntly rounded in dorsal profile, but acutely rounded in lateral profile.  The nostrils are directed dorsolaterally.  Its eyes are relatively small and dorsolateral.  Its mouth is moderately small and anteroventral.  Lips are each bordered by a row of small papillae, interrupted medially above the upper lip, with more papillae present in lateral folds on either side of the lips.  The beaks are moderately heavy with small, pointed serrations.  The upper beak is shaped like a high arch with long, slender, lateral processes, while the lower beak is broadly V-shaped.  Two upper and three lower rows of teeth are present, with the upper rows equal in row length, but lower rows getting progressively less wide.  The spiracle is long and sinistral, opening just below the midline at a point about midlength on the body. The vent is short and dextral.  The tadpole has moderately heavy caudal musculature which does not extend to the tip of the tail.  At the midlength of the tail, the depth of the musculature is equal to the depth of either fin (Duellman 2001).  

The tadpole is a dull, grayish-brown color with a creamy, tan caudal musculature.  Its fins are transparent with brown reticulations. The iris is pale bronze (Duellman 2001).

This frog is endemic to the Yucatan peninsula (Duellman and Klaas 1964).  It extends through southern Mexico, through Belize and Guatemala, and ranges as far south as the central savanna areas of El Peten, Guatemala (Duellman 2001).  It is found in lowland subhumid semi-deciduous (xerophilous) forest, with a low amount of rainfall that is highly seasonal, at elevations of 0-740 m (IUCN 2006; Duellman 2001) as well as  savannas (Duellman 2001).  It favors shallow soils on porous limestone (Duellman and Klaas 1964).      
","
 This frog breeds during the rainy season, which runs from late April/early May through October (Duellman 2001). It prefers temporary bodies of water consisting of solution pits, sink holes, and aguadas formed by rains (Duellman 2001).  Males will call from branches of low trees and bushes around solution basins at about 2.5 m above the ground (Duellman 2001).  Duellman and Klass (1964) described the calls as a series of rapidly repeated single, low-pitched notes, resembling the quacking of a duck. Calls consist of 33-54 notes, at a rate of about 48.7 calls/minute.  Individual notes have a duration of .26-.35 seconds, at  a pulse rate of 80-90 pulses/second. The dominant frequency is 1900-2450 cycles/second, with the fundamental frequency varying from 210-350 cycles/second. Sometimes a single note will increase slightly in pitch, probably because of increased distension in the vocal sac (Duellman and Klaas 1964). 
Amplexing pairs are found 2.5 m above ground; many are observed in trees (Duellman 2001).  Eggs are deposited in clumps in solution pits or shallow, limestone basins (Duellman and Klaas 1964).  The egg deposition sites are 40 cm deep and 15-80 cm in diameter, usually containing some decaying vegetation (Duellman and Klaas 1964).  Embryo diameter at stage 11 is 1.65 to 1.95 mm. with fertilization membrane diameter ranging from 1.8 to 2.44 mm, and the outer envelopes from 4.06 to 5.25 mm (Duellman and Klaas 1964).  Embryos were a uniform, speckled pale brown at stage 15, with the neural groove, stomodeal cleft, optic vesicle, gill plates, and invagination of the proctodeum all evident (Duellman and Klaas 1964).  

This species is thought to spend days as well as the dry season in tree holes (Duellman 2001).  Individuals have been observed plugging the tree holes with their heads (Stuart 1935). 

   

","

","
Overall, this species is very abundant.  Peripheral populations appear to be decreasing while others are probably increasing, but he population is considered stable (IUCN 2006).
","
 This animal is collected for the pet trade.  About half of the frogs taken for these reasons are taken from the wild, the other half coming from captive breeding and farming (IUCN 2006).
","
This frog's cranial osteology has been studied in some detail (Trueb 1970).  The specific namepetasatus is derived from Latin, meaning ""with a hat on"".  This designation refers to its helmet-like casque (Duellman 2001).

Known to occur only in the Restinga habitat of coastal Brazil along the Atlantic ocean at low elevations.
","
In a highly unusual behavior among frogs, Xenohyla truncata has been observed feeding on the fruits, nectar, and flowers of the Brazilian milk fruit tree Cordia taguahyensis (de-Oliveira-Nogueira et al 2023). (It may be the only frog known to feed on nectar, as the Asian dicroglossid Euphlyctis hexadactylus is known to consume plant parts regularly.) The flower structure of this tree species allows the frog to enter and exit the flower easily. While feeding, the pollen grains adhere to the frogâ€™s back and are transported to other flowers while visiting them. Based on this observation, de-Oliveira-Nogueira et al suggest that X. truncata is not only a seed disperser, but also a potential pollinator of C. taguahyensis, or even of other plant species with similar floral structure. Its role as a pollinator is yet to be confirmed.
","

","
Conversion of lowland coastal habitat into commercial, industrial and residential development threaten the species.

Their unique and novel ecological role feeding on the Brazilian milk fruit tree highlights the importance of fundamental natural history information for this endemic tree frog species. Likely with rapidly disappearing Restinga habitat in Brazil it is feared that we may lose this frog species and a unique amphibian-plant interaction (de-Oliveira-Nogueira et al 2023).
","

","
This species was highlighted in News of the Week 29 May 2023:
De-Oliveira-Nogueira et al (2023) reports a new behavior and relationship between an amphibian and plant: the South American tree frog Xenohyla truncata has been observed feeding on nectar and flowers of the Brazilian milk fruit tree Cordia taguahyensis. The flower structure of this tree species allows the frog to enter and exit the flower easily. During their feeding activity, the pollen grains adhere to the frogâ€™s back and are transported to other flowers while visiting them. Based on this observation, the authors suggest that X. truncata is not only a seed disperser, but also a potential pollinator of C. taguahyensis, or even of other plant species with similar floral structure. This finding is a unique and novel natural history behavior and highlights the importance of fundamental natural history information for this endemic tree frog species, which exclusively lives in the rapidly disappearing Restinga habitat on the coast of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. With expanding development and habitat destruction, it is feared that losing this frog species, currently threatened with extinction, also means the extinction of a unique amphibian-plant interaction, especially important as it is a first known for a frog. Thus, conservation of this tree frog species has heightened stakes. (Umi Arifin)

Hylodes asper lives along forest streams and rivers.  For territorial displays in this high-noise environment, the frog uses a kind of semaphoring (slowly raising and waving a rear leg, one at a time), in addition to calling.  This behavior is known as foot-flagging, since the slow waving of the frog's large rear foot resembles a flag waving.

A member of the Hylodes lateristrigatus group which contains small to moderate sized species characterized by slender bodies, smooth dorsums, and light dorsolateral stripes (Heyer 1982; Haddad and Pombal 1995) 
. This species, like other members of the genus, are found in the Atlantic forests of Brazil, usually near streams maintained by waterfalls. Hylodes heyeri, named in honor of Ron Heyer who has contributed a lot to the knowledge of anurans in Brazil, has a head longer than wide, snout round in dorsal view and acuminate-protruding in lateral view. Nostrils are slightly protuberant and directed laterally. There is a weak supratympanic fold which extends from the posterior edge of the eye to the groin. Arms are robust, thumbs with nuptial pads are without spines. Upper surfaces of finger discs have well-developed scutes. Dorsal skin texture is slightly rugose, posterior region of the body and flanks dorsally rugose; undersurfaces smooth. Rugose textures is also found near the vent and on the ventral surfaces of the thighs. In life, H. heyeri is dark brown dorsally, the upper surfaces of the forelimbs, tibia, and foot are brown with dark irregular spots. Upper surfaces of thigh and gorin are greenish brown with dark irregular spots. A brownish white line extends from the shoulder to the goirn, along with a whitish lateral stripe extending from tip of snout to the arm insertion. Throat is silver gray with a dark gray belly. Iris is copper colored. Not all individuals have the large tubercles on the upper surfaces of feet, toes, hands and fingers.  
 
Adveritsement call information are as follows: given sporadically, at an air temperature of 21-23 celsius, call durations are 0.72-1.53 sec; 21-37 notes per call given at a rate of 23.4-29.9/sec; note duration .03-.04 sec; dominant frequency range of 3.7-4.3 kHz. See Haddad et al. (1996)  fig. 3 for harmonic and call structure diagrams.

Only known from the type locality in the vicinity of Caverna do Diabo, Eldorado, State of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The habitat consisted of a stream near a waterfall with rocks and a cave, both from which males called. 
 

","
Males were observed calling in November and January (wet season). Males are diurnal and call from hsaded places on rocks and in rock crevices of small-to medium sized streams (some even from caves)

A very large (30â€“40 mm) Afrixalus from the savannas of eastern and southern Africa; dark with broad light silverish dorsolateral bands from tip of snout to anus. The bands meet posteriorly, not anteriorly. About half the specimens in northern populations (Tanzania and Kenya) have the entire dorsum silverish white. Upper side of tibia white. 
The males have numerous large conspicuous black-tipped asperities on head, back, dorsal surfaces of limbs and around the anus. The females have smaller asperities. 
Pickersgill (1996) regard the populations where the uniform-backed specimens occur as a separate species, Afrixalus unicolor (Boettger 1913), without arguing for its specific distinctness.  
Drewes & Altig (1996) have reported that A. fornasini preys on eggs and developing larvae of other frogs (Chiromantis xerampelina, Hyperolius sp. and  
A. fornasini). 
Voice. â€“ A typical Afrixalus sound, but loud, slow and low-pitched as can be expected from such a large animal. The voice has been compared with the stuttering of a minute machine-gun by Wager. There is a slow, creaking initial sound followed by a series of figures at a rate of 5â€“10 per second and with a frequency-intensity maximum at about 2500 cps. 
 
 
 

","
Afrixalus fornasinii is a characteristic element in the savanna, possibly preferring rather dense savanna with larger bushes and trees. It is found in the coastal lowlands, but also on localities up to 1300 metres in Malawi (Stewart 1967). To the south it is again confined to the coastal tropical lowlands of South Africa.

A medium to small Hyperolius (males 18â€“26, females 21â€“29) from bushland in central Africa. Very variable, often with yellow lateral band. Pupil horizontal. Voice a scream.
Colour is very variable between populations. In general:
Phase J. Dorsum translucent brownish-green with a darker, diffuse canthal streak. 
A faint thin light dorsolateral line often present. Ventrum dark reddish, feet red.
Phase F. Dorsum dense green. A broad irregular white to yellow black-edged lateral stripe, often split up into spots, is present in some populations, absent in others. 
A few specimens have yellow spots on dorsum. Ventrum dark red, feet red. Throat of males yellow. 
Laurent has described 11 subspecies within a very restricted range in Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Kivu. I have more than doubled the range into Uganda, north-western Tanzania and western Kenya, and my samples present as much variation as Laurentâ€™s. This variation does not seem to resolve itself into recognisable clines and I feel therefore that the complex is, with our present knowledge, best treated as one monotypic but very variable species.
Some populations of H. lateralis are very similar to H. cinnamomeoventris. H. lateralis is generally smaller, has a briefer snout and less conspicuous pattern. The voices are quite different. The similarity to H. castaneus is mentioned under that species.

This species shows developmental changes in patterning, with two phases, J (juveniles and many mature males) and F (mature females and some mature males).   All newly metamorphosed individuals are phase J, which is normally brownish to green with paired light dorsolateral lines, or an hourglass pattern.  All females, and some males, develop into phase F before the first breeding season.  Phase F is often colorful and variable, showing the diagnostic color characteristics for the species or subspecies.  Either well-defined morphs may be present, or graded variation.

 A medium-sized Hyperolius with a maximum body length of about 33 mm. Pupil horizontal. The adult color pattern is extremely variable and has led to many systematic and nomenclatural uncertainties about this â€˜superspeciesâ€™.  Ongoing investigations into the ecology, call structure and genetics of populations from different parts of Africa will help to resolve the taxonomy of this group (Minter et al. 2004).  The pattern varies from distinct stripes through to vermiculations, dots and splotches, and the colours of the patterns vary from dark brown or black through to yellow and peppermint green.  Juvenile males appear to be overall brown during their first breeding season (see photograph of juveniles in combat).

For another description of H. marmoratus, see the H. viridiflavus superspecies account (by A. SchiÃ¸tz).
","
This species forms part of a large complex of geographical variants distributed across most of sub-Saharan Africa. 

","
The adults aestivate during the dry season, and have been found sheltering some distance from their breeding sites in vegetation or under logs and stones. During this time they often take up residence inside houses, where they conceal themselves behind cupboards, pelmets, pictures and in toilet cisterns. The breeding behaviour of this species is arguably the most well documented for any African frog, with over 15 papers and numerous theses relating to the subject published within the last ten years.  
 
Although males will call after rain at any time of the year, breeding normally takes place from October to February. At low altitudes male calling behaviour is inhibited by temperatures below 16Â°C, while at higher altitudes breeding has been observed at temperatures below 10Â°C. 
 
During the day, adults usually move into the canopy of surrounding trees or bask in the sun on emergent vegetation at the edge of the breeding site. H. marmoratus utilise a wide variety of breeding sites, ranging from temporary ponds and seepages to permanent bodies of water such as dams, marshes, reedbeds, sluggish rivers and streams (Channing 2001). At dusk they descend to the pond where males take up specific call sites (which they return to on consecutive nights) and call consistently from dusk to just after midnight. Where present, tall emergent plants such as reeds and sedges (e.g. Eleocharis limosa, Cyperus papyrus and Typha latifolia) are favored as call sites, but males will also call from trees, grasses, bushes, floating vegetation or even bare soil at the waterâ€™s edge. 
 
On average, males only call for a few nights in a row, returning to the breeding chorus after a period of about 10 days (Dyson et al. 1992). Gravid females enter the pond shortly after dusk and usually select a mate within a few hours. After several hours in axillary amplexus, the eggs are laid in water. Females have been observed to lay more than one clutch of eggs per season with a month long interval between layings (pers. obs.).  
Between 150 and 650 eggs are laid in flattened clumps of about 20, on the surface of submerged leaves, stalks or stones or amongst the roots of aquatic plants (Channing 2001). Tadpoles hatch within 5 days and metamorphosis takes about 6-8 weeks. 

","

","
The major threat to this species is habitat loss through drainage of wetlands and afforestation.  In several areas of prime habitat, the planting of exotic Eucalyptus forests has lowered the water table to such a degree that many ponds within the coastal dune forest have completely disappeared (Minter et al. 2004). 
 
The Painted Reed Frog is locally abundant and sub-populations often consist of hundreds or occasionally thousands of individuals. They occur in many protected areas including National Parks and appear not to require any further conservation action.

Ventrum white; limbs, feet and discs green, or discs sometimes reddish. Pupil horizontal. The males are of the same size as the females which is unusual among Hyperolius. In some populations the females lack the light dorsolateral stripe, while it is present in others.

","
A common and widespread element in the savanna fauna, most noticeably in the more humid, dense savanna, from central West Africa (central CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire) to East Africa and further south, and into the savanna of R. D. Congo and Angola. Due to confusion with H. benguellensis, H. poweri and H. sp., names which may or may not cover valid species and which may replace H. nasutus or may exist sympatric with it, an exact distribution cannot be given.



","
The call is a high-pitched scream consisting of an initial sound and a small number of elements.

The eggs are laid submerged in water in batches of about 200. They have a white and greenish-grey pole. 



","

","

","

","
This species is called Hyperolius acuticeps (Channing et al. 2002) or Hyperolius igbettensis in some recent literature.  Due to nomenclatorial uncertainty, the well established name H. nasutus is used here (SchiÃ¸tz 2006).

Several subspecies have been described, but our understanding of the variation within this species is not sufficient to establish such subspecies. Furthermore the complex may contain several cryptic species. Thus in southern Africa, the very similar H. benguellensis has recently been recognized as a separate species. 
Channing has stated that the South African populations differ, 
e.g. in voice, from more northern populations of H. nasustus and should be recognised as H. poweri Loveridge 1938.
There is a form in south-western Cameroun southwards at least as far as R. Congo, probably to Kinshasa in R. D. Congo, which is probably a distinct species. It is similar to H. nasutus but differs in morphology, having a briefer snout and a broader body, and has a somewhat different voice and habitat preference (bushland and humid savanna). This species is being studied by Amiet, and has been recorded as Hyperolius sp. aff. nasutus by Largen and Dowsett-Lemaire (1991) from R. Congo.

From sea level to timberline, ranging along Pacific coast of North America from northern California to southern British Columbia. Also includes a disjuct distribution in northern Idaho and western Montana (Nussbaum et al 1983).  Associated with cold,  fast-moving streams with cobbled bottoms and emergent boulders (Bull and Carter 1996). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Ascaphus is non-vocal. Its internal fertilization (an adaption to ensure fertilization in fast moving streams) is unique among frogs. Breeding season lasts from May through September.  Eggs are deposited in strings under rocks in fast-moving streams.  Tailed frogs are primarily aquatic; adults may emerge to forage on land in cool, wet conditions, especially at night.  Larvae take between 1 to 4 years to metamorphose, depending on drainage (Bull and Carter 1996; Wallace and Diller 1998) . 
Juveniles are sexually mature in 7-8 years.  Maximum average Ascaphusdensity per linear meter of stream was 0.162 larvae and 0.035 adults in western Oregon (Bull and Carter 1996). 
Nussbaum et al (1983) cite densities as high as 1 frog per meter of stream in eastern Washington. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
Not federally listed, but a California Species of Special concern.  Habitat modification due to timber harvesting may be a major cause of declines in Ascaphus. Bull and Carter (1996) found that the presence of a tree-lined buffer zone was significantly correlated with Tailed frog abundance, while overall logging level within the watershed showed only a non-significant trend.  In British Columbia, conservation plans are difficult to implement, since Tailed Frogs (along with Pacific Giant Salamanders, Dicamptodon tenebrosus) avoid areas with predatory game fish;  
it is the riparian areas with those game fish that are protected (Orchard 1992). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
Ascaphus is the only living representative of a basal lineage of anurans, and may retain some relatively primitive traits of early frogs (e.g. Ford and Cannatella 1992).

Terrestrial; can be found in moist forests, grassy clearings, ridges, and sub-alpine scrub around 200-1000 m altitude.  Nocturnal; likes to take shelter under stone and logs by day (Gill and Whitaker 1996). 


","
Call: No loud breeding call (Gill and Whitaker 1996).  
Squeak or chirp when annoyed, distressed, or during sexual activity.  Has no true voice-box; dominant frequencies and overtones of call notes depend on resonance frequencies in head and body, not vibration frequency of vocal chords (Green 1988). 

Defense: Can remain motionless for long periods of time.  Assumes stiff-legged stance, rearing up and extending the legs (Green 1988). 

Reproduction: Amplexus takes place in shallow depressions beneath logs, where itâ€™s cool and moist.  Egg clusters are later laid in strings.  Diameters of egg capsules range from 8 to 11 mm.  Eggs are yolky, unpigmented, and enclosed in clear capsules comprised of an outer, tougher, and initially somewhat adhesive coat, a middle gelatinous layer, and an inner vitelline membrane.  Sometimes frogs, particularly males, occupy the oviposition sites for weeks or longer prior to the laying of eggs.  Takes froglets at least 3 to 4 years to reach maturity.  In their development, they have narrow tail fins, and only the base of the forelimbs is covered by the gular fold (Bell 1978).

Archeyâ€™s frog (Leiopelma archeyi) is considered one of the most endangered and evolutionarily distinct frogs in the world. This small frog occurs in the moist, subalpine scrub of New Zealandâ€™s North Island in the Coromandel Peninsula and the Whareorino Forest, and is known for its direct developing young (having no tadpole stage). In March 2018, New Zealandâ€™s Department of Conservation will proactively combat one of the threats to the frogs by setting out over a thousand self-resetting rat traps in Whareorino Forest. The deployment of automatically resetting rat traps apparently has the benefit of reducing the need for human intervention which allows long unsupervised implementation as well as reducing the exposure of the tiny frogs to human-transmitted diseases in these remote areas. The NZ Department of Conservation has shown that reducing introduced predators such as rats has allowed frog populations to stabilize and do well in translocated areas like Pureora, south of the Coromandel Peninsula (Written by Michelle Koo).

Call: No loud breeding call (Gill and Whitaker 1996). 
 Squeak or chirp when annoyed, distressed, or during sexual activity.  Has no true voice-box; dominant frequencies and overtones of call notes depend on resonance frequencies in head and body, not vibration frequency of vocal chords (Green 1988). 

Defense: Can remain motionless for long periods of time.  Does not assume a rigid headbutting stance with raised body and extended legs like L. hamiltoni and L. archeyi; more likely to try to escape in water.  Uses double legged ""frog-kick"" for initial few strokes and then a ""dog-paddle"" motion (Green 1988). 

Reproduction: Amplexus takes place on land, in shallow water, or at the edge of water.  Male grips female tightly around the groin immediately anterior to the hind legs. Takes froglets at least 3 to 4 years to reach maturity.  In their development, a broad gular fold covers the forelimbs, and the tail fin is well developed (Bell 1978).

This species was featured in News of the Week 5 June 2023:
Foam nests are a unique reproductive strategy used by frogs providing eggs and larva protection from desiccation, predation, and suffocation while also aiding in fertilization and providing a food source for developing larvae. More recently, the protein and carbohydrate rich foam also has been associated with the vertical transfer of beneficial microbial communities in rhacophorid frogs. Monteiro et al. (2023) characterized the protein composition and microbiome of the nests of three Leptodactylid species: Adenomera hylaedactyla, Leptodactylus vastus, and Physalaemus cuvieri, with each representing a different spawning habitat type. They found that protein composition was species-specific and was influenced more by spawn habitat type and nest size than phylogenetic relatedness. Many of these proteins were previously unidentified. Additionally, the microbiome community of the nest was unique from the surrounding environment and the adult skin microbiome. These findings show that foam nests have a key functional role in reproduction and highlight the need for conservation efforts to protect nests from anthropic pressures, as each nest has a unique microenvironment.

","
 Edalorhina perezi is a toad-like South American frog with an appearance similar to that of a dead leaf. Snout-vent length ranges from 24 - 37 mm, with females being larger than the males (Deichmann et al. 2008). The snout is rounded, often with a cone shaped tubercle at the tip. Its tympanum is oval, with a length about the same as the eye. Above the eye sit several dermal protrusions (â€œhornsâ€), which look similar to eyelashes. A dermal fold runs from behind the eye to the hind leg insertions, and gives E. perezi a flat, leaf-like appearance when viewed form above (Cope 1874). Vomerine teeth are either poorly developed or absent. Toes are slightly webbed (Dunn 1949).

Adult E. perezi can be distinguished from its sister taxon E. nasuta by the shape and characters of the head. E. perezi has a short, rounded snout and very prominent tubercles on the upper eyelid, while E. nasuta has a long, pointed, fleshy snout and less pronounced eyelid tubercles (Duellman and Morales 1990).

The dorsum and dorsal surfaces of the limbs may be blotched or striped brown, while the venter is white with black bands and spots. The sides of the body are black. Bright yellow coloration may be seen on the undersides and insertions of the limbs (Cope 1874).

 Dorsal skin texture and ventral color pattern vary geographically. The dorsum may be smooth, have 4-5 tubercles, have many tubercles, or have paired dermal ridges running down the back. The venter can range from mostly white with black present laterally to all black other than a white throat with black flecks (Duellman and Morales 1990). Vomerine teeth and an interocular dermal ridge may also be present or absent depending on location. Development of a wart on the snout also varies between individuals (Dunn 1949).
","
Edalorhina perezi is distributed throughout the Amazonian lowlands of Peru, Ecuador, southern Colombia, western Brazil, and possibly Bolivia. It is found between 100 and 1100 meters above sea level (Angulo et al. 2004).

Edalorhina perezi is diurnal and inhabits leaf litter in the lowland and premontane forests east of the Andes. The species can also be found in secondary or disturbed forest habitats (Angulo et al. 2004).

","
Edalorhina perezi can be found in shaded leaf litter during the day, and is most active following rains (Duellman and Morales 1990).

During the breeding season, males are solitary vocalists (no breeding aggregations), calling from the forest floor, well distanced from one another. The call consists of three to five low pitched, short whistles that are frequency modulated with a dominant frequency around 2700 Hz. Harmonics are present at 5400 and 8100 Hz. The call is repeated four or five times, with 0.13 - 0.20 seconds between calls. Call groups are spaced several minutes apart (Duellman and Morales 1990).

Amplexus in E. perezi is axillary, and may last for up to 6 days. The female secretes the material that will make up the nest, then the male â€œbeatsâ€ it into foam. Nest construction takes 30 minutes to 2 hours. Multiple nests may be constructed in one night with each being between 50 - 75 mm in diameter. Up to thirty to forty small, unpigmented eggs (around 2.5mm diameter) are laid in each nest (SchlÃ¼ter 1990). Tadpoles develop in the nest for 4 - 5 days, and then exit the nest at stage 25 with a body length of around 4.1 mm and a total length of around 10.5 mm (Duellman and Morales 1990).
","
Edalorhina perezi tadpoles are light brown with darker brown mottling on their top and sides (SchlÃ¼ter 1990).
Tadpoles hatch at stage 25 with a body length of around 4.1 mm and a total length of around 10.5 mm. The body is robust and wider than it is deep. Snout is rounded, eyes are located dorsolaterally. The mouth is anteroventrally oriented. The caudal fins are equal in depth to the tail musculature and each other. Tail tip is rounded (SchlÃ¼ter 1990). Two upper and two lower rows of denticles are present. The tadpoles do not have external gills or adhesive organs. Tadpoles at stage 41 have a body length of 10.1 - 10.2 mm and a total length of 27.1 - 27.9 mm (Duellman and Morales 1990).
","
Edalorhina perezi has a wide range, a large, stable population, and is tolerant to modified or disturbed habitats. The species also occurs in many protected areas throughout its range. Local populations may be threatened by habitat loss due to logging or agriculture, but the species as a whole is not threatened (Angulo et al. 2004).


","

","
The species authority for E. perezi is Don Marcos JimÃ©nez de la Espada, 1871. 

Edalorhina perezi is synonymous with Bubonias plicifrons (Cope, 1874) and E. buckleyi (Boulenger, 1882). Edalorhina perezi was distinguished based on characters such as wart organization and vomerine teeth, which are now considered to be variation within a single species (Dunn 1949).

Edalorhina perezi is the sister taxon to E. nasuta, the only other member of Edalorhina. The closest relatives of the genus,Edalorhina, are the genera Physalaemus and Pleurodema (LourenÃ§o et al. 2000).

Edalorhina perezi has a diploid number of 2n=22 (LourenÃ§o et al. 2000).

Males are approximately 30 mm long and females are slightly larger.  The skin of the TÃºngara frog is brown and pustular, giving it a toadlike appearance that is reflected in its scientific name (Ryan 1985). 

No teeth are present on the maxilla and premaxilla; tubercles are present on the dorsum in a variable pattern that may include large tubercles in longitudinal rows, chevrons, or both large and small tubercles randomly scattered (Cannatella and Duellman 1984).  It also has a tuberculate tympanic membrane and the first finger is longer than the second. 

","
Mexico to Colombia and Venezuela, generally in lowland areas (up to 1,540 m asl) (Santos-Barrera et al. 2008).  Found in savannahs as well as both natural and disturbed humid lowland and montane forest, tropical dry forest, and open environments such as pastures.  Can tolerate secondary growth and forest edges. Often found near ponds, both natural and man-made. It also makes use of smaller bodies of water such as ditches, puddles, and potholes. 
 
 
 
 

","
Engystomops pustulosus lays its eggs in foam nests, generally under cover, in pools.  The foam nests are believed to prevent egg desiccation during brief periods without rain (Ryan 1985).  Laying eggs under cover may help avoid predation (Tarano 1998).  Eggs are laid in a variety of habitats, including disturbed areas.  However, pond use is correlated with proximity to other ponds, making this species vulnerable to habitat fragmentation (Marsh et al. 1999). 

 
Males call at night while floating in the water. The call has two components: a whine and 0-6 chucks. Studies show that females prefer the calls with the chucks incorporated, but males of this species are preyed upon by the fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus) which homes in on the chucks, providing an interesting case of sexual selection opposing natural selection (Ryan 1985). 

","

","
This species is generally quite common in Central and South America and can occupy diverse habitats, including disturbed ones. It is not common in Belize or in southwestern Campeche, Mexico. It does not seem to be currently threatened.  Its range overlaps with a number of protected areas (Santos-Barrera et al. 2008).

Can frogs with foam nests help make biofuels? The long-lasting foam nests of the TÃºngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus) help protect its tadpoles. Now a team of researchers has designed a novel artificial photosynthesis system suspended in a foam, using the TÃºngara frog surfactant protein Ranaspumin-2. The system could produce up to 10-fold more biofuel per hectare than plants and could be used on rooftops and nonarable land (Wendell et al. 2010). For other properties of the foam nests, see below for News of the Week.

This species was featured as News of the Week on 14 January 2019:
Human activities ranging from vehicle traffic to industry are making the world an increasingly noisy place to live in; two recent studies show frogs have found ways to cope with the human soundscape. Tennessen et al. (2018) studied wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) in northeastern United States where noise from vehicle traffic is physiologically stressful to recently metamorphosed tadpoles, negatively impacting frog health. However, these researchers found that wood frogs from populations living near human noise have rapidly evolved to no longer be stressed by noisy human environments. In Panama, predators like bats and midges avoid noisy urban areas because they rely on sounds to hunt. Halfwerk and colleagues (2018) found that male tÃºngara frogs (Engystomops pustulosus) from urban habitats can flexibly adjust their calls. Urban dwelling male tÃºngara create more conspicuous calls, which are more attractive to females. When these urban males are placed in the forest, they adjust their calls to be less conspicuous and therefore less obvious to predators. Male tÃºngara frogs from forests are unable to flexibly adjust their calls if they are placed in the city. Together, these studies show that some frogs species can rapidly evolve to deal with noisy human environments whereas others can adjust their behaviors accordingly (Written by Max Lambert).

Amphibians serve as the inspiration to several biomedical research studies, including tissue regeneration (Mexican Axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum), suture substances (Chinese Giant Salamander, Andrias davidianus), and cryogenics (Wood Frog, Rana sylvatica). The latest inspiration comes from the foam nests that some frogs create during reproduction, which protects eggs and larvae from predators, parasites, desiccation, and aides in gas exchange, and temperature regulation. Brozio and colleagues (2021) demonstrated that the foam, created by aerating reproductive secretions, of TÃºngara Frog (Engystomops pustulosus) has potential as a topical pharmaceutical foam for drug delivery as it is stable for up to 10 days, is biocompatible, and is capable of carrying a variety of compounds, including antibiotics. These exciting results require more testing, both in TÃºngara Frog as well as other foam nest building frog species, and may have broad uses in medicine.

Leptodactylus mystacinus is a moderately sized species of frog, ranging from 44-65 mm SVL in adult males and 54-67 mm SVL in adult females. The two genders can be distinguished from from one another by the flatter snouts and lack of asperities on the thumbs and chest of adult males. Both genders have heads that are proportionally as long as they are wide. This species has relatively short back legs with narrow, smooth toe tips. Much of the lower leg is covered in white tubercles, and among most individuals, these nodules continue down across the top and bottom of the foot. As the specific epithet suggests, a light stripe of color covers the upper lip like a mustache. Coloration differs among individuals; the dorsal region can be a solid brown, or it may be striped or dotted with dark brown. The ventral region is usually either a solid light color or mottled with different shades of brown. In individuals with mottled bellies, the coloring is more intense around the arm insertions.

In the larval stage, the dorsal fin and body length of Leptodactylus mystacinus are clearly differentiated; the dorsal fin ends where the body begins. Larvae are usually 46-48 mm long, with 17-18 mm of that length taken up by the body. Eye diameters are about 10% of this body size, while oral disks are almost 23%.  L. mystacinus larvae have brown bodies and brown and cream mottled tails (Heyer et al. 2003).

","
Leptodactylus mystacinus is found in subtropical arid and mesic regions throughout much of the mideastern portion of South America. It ranges from the Yungas Mountains in northwestern Argentina to the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains in Bolivia, and over into Uruguay and around Bahia, Brazil. L. mystacinus usually inhabits forests with closed canopies, but has also been found in clearings throughout the central and southern Atlantic Forests in Brazil (Heyer et al. 2003).






","
The advertising call of L. mystacinus consists of a single note repeated an average of 250-400 times per minute for a length of 0.04-0.06 seconds. When recorded, it was found that this call had very little amplitude or frequency modulation. The frequency is generally 2050-2500 Hz, with a minimal rise of 50 Hz possible from the start to the end of the call (Heyer et al. 2003).

In Greek, ""mystax"" means upper lip or mustache. The light coloration covering the lip of Leptodactylus mystacinus is distinct in most individuals,  giving the appearance of a mustache (Heyer et al. 2003).

Leptodactylus pentadactylus, the Smoky Jungle Frog, is a large frog.  Adult males can reach 177 mm while the larger females can measure up to 185 mm (Savage 2002). This frog can be distinguished from other frogs by the presence of paired dorsolateral folds, paired lumbar glands, and a spotted or barred upper lip, as well as its large size  
(Savage 2002).  This species has a smooth dorsum, definite inguinal glands, and large eyes and tympana 
(Savage 2002).  The snout is rounded, almost semicircular when viewed from above  
(Savage 2002).  Adult males have paired elongated vocal slits and a single internal subgular vocal sac  
(Savage 2002). In addition, adult males have extremely muscular forelimbs and a pair of black spines on the chest, plus a black spine on each thumb  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Dorsolateral folds extend from each eye to the groin  
(Hero and Galatti 1990). The adult coloration has been described as either uniform gray to reddish brown, or with darker spots or bars on the ground color 
(Savage 2002), It has also been described as a dark purple and light brown reticulum 
 (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  The underside is dark gray with white to yellow mottling or tiny white speckles  
(Savage 2002).  The posterior thigh has small white spots on a black background. A dark interorbital bar is present  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Young frogs are more brightly colored than adults and have toe ridges  
(Savage 2002).  
 
Tadpoles of this species are giant and elongate, growing up to 83 mm at stage 40  
(Savage 2002; Hero and Galatti 1990).  Dorsally, the tadpole is brown, with a lighter ventral surface 
(Savage 2002). The mouth is almost terminal, while the nostrils and eyes are on the dorsal side  
(Savage 2002). The spiracle is located laterally and sinistrally and the vent is medial  
(Savage 2002).  This species has a long tail with low fins and a pointed tail tip  
(Savage 2002).  The oral disk is complete and moderate, having two serrated beaks and 2/3 rows of denticles, with a broad gap in the row of denticles immediately above the mouth  
(Savage 2002).  Labial papillae are lacking above the mouth, but are usually found in two rows lateral to the mouth and a single row ventral to the mouth  
(Savage 2002).  The lateral line system is well-developed, particularly in comparison with larvae of other Leptodactylus species  
(Heyer et al. 1975).  
","
The Smoky Jungle Frog can be found from Honduras southward into South America. L. pentadactylus is widespread in lowland rainforest on both Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Costa Rica from sea level to 1,200 m (Leenders 2001). It prefers forest habitat near swamps and slowly flowing streams (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). It may also be found inhabiting areas distant from bodies of water (Galatti 1992).
","
  These frogs can be long-lived and have a potential life-span of at least 15 years  
(Leenders 2001).  Adults are nocturnal and stay in hiding during the day, sheltering in subterranean burrows, beneath logs, in the spaces between tree roots, or under houses  
(Savage 2002).  Juveniles, however, are active during the day and can be found on top of the leaf litter  
(Savage 2002).  This species prefers dimly lit forest  
(Jaeger and Hailman 1981).  At the first sign of dusk, males of this species give off a loud ""wrooop"" 
 (Leenders 2001). The call lacks pulses  
(Hero and Galatti 1990). Males are territorial and call sporadically from burrows located underneath a log or rock, often in densely vegetated areas  
(Leenders 2001).  
Mating is believed to take place throughout the rainy season months of May to November  
(Savage 2002). However, Hero and Galatti  
(1990) observed that males in the central Amazon region of Brazil began calling immediately after the first substantial rains, in late September, and that calling ceased after two to four weeks.  Both calling and breeding take place at the water's edge; it is not known whether the same burrows used for shelter are also used as nest sites  
(Savage 2002). Amplexus is axillary in this species  
(Savage 2002).  As the male hugs the female under the armpits with his robust forearms, he creates a large foamy mass around the eggs by rapidly moving his back legs through the jelly surrounding the fertilized eggs 
(Heyer and Rand 1977).  This foam nest consists of a frothy mix of sperm, skin secretions, water, and air 
(Heyer and Rand 1977).  Females lay about 1,000 light gray eggs, and the foam nests are constructed in dry cavities or depressions  
(Savage 2002). These hollows may be natural or possibly excavated by the males  
(Muedeking and Heyer 1976).  Foam nests may be constructed near puddles, temporary pools or in seasonally flooded spots, such that rain washes the larvae out of the nests and into nearby small rain pools  
(Breder 1946).  Alternatively, foam nests have been observed in open depressions at some distance from water, so that tadpoles develop within the nest until metamorphosis  
(Muedeking and Heyer 1976; Hero and Galatti 1990).  In the latter case, Muedeking and Heyer  
(1976) noted both larvae and eggs in the nests, and inferred that eggs were being consumed by larvae.  Leptodactylus pentadactylus larvae are unusually resistant to desiccation for anuran tadpoles, and can survive almost seven days out of water  
(Valerio 1971). Foam nests also provide protection to larvae from desiccation  
(Heyer 1969). 
 
Galatti (1992) observed that the strong seasonality in Leptodactylus pentadactylus reproduction in Brazil coincided with arthropod prey availability.  He observed two peaks in arthropod abundance, one in late September (when the adults arrived at breeding sites), and the second in January and February, when tadpoles completed metamorphosis into juvenile frogs  
(Galatti 1992).  These peaks did not completely correspond to rainfall, as the first peak in arthropod prey abundance occurred during the late dry season and the second occurred during the wet season  
(Galatti 1992).   
 
Leptodactylus pentadactylus is able to secrete huge amounts of mucus as an antipredator defense (Savage 2002). In addition to making the frog slippery and difficult to hold, the skin secretions are toxic  
(Savage 2002). Savage  
(2002) points out that this toxicity is evident both from direct contact (resulting in human skin rashes and stinging) and indirect contact, from being in the same room when the frog is handled (which results in sneezing and swelling of human eyes and mucus membranes).  The residue from these skin secretions is lethal to other frogs which come in contact with it  
(Savage 2002). 
 
Leptodactylus pentadactylus also exhibits defensive behavior, which consists of facing the predator, inflating and elevating the body with all four limbs  
(Villa 1969; Savage 2002).  This has the effect of raising the posterior, glandular surfaces above the level of the head since the hind limbs are longer  
(Villa 1969; Savage 2002).  Initial elevation is followed by repeated raising and lowering of the body  
(Villa 1969; Savage 2002).   
 
These frogs are opportunistic feeders.  Adults consume anything that they can swallow, including bird chicks, snakes, other frogs (particularly dendrobatids, despite their toxicity), and scorpions  
(Leenders 2001). Tadpoles initially feed on the foam produced by the male, but later will either eat algae  
(Vinton 1951) or become carnivorous, preying on eggs and tadpoles of their own species or other species  
(Muedeking and Heyer 1976; Heyer et al. 1975).   
 
Predators on Leptodactylus pentadactylus eggs include the ephydrid fly Gastrops willistoni, which lays its own eggs on L. pentadactylus clutches in Costa Rica and Brazil  
(Villa et al. 1982). Predators on the adult frogs include coatimundis, snakes, and caimans. When discovered, these frogs often remains still and easily approached. If caught, however, they will emit an extremely loud, high-pitched scream to startle potential predators  
(Leenders 2001).  
 
Research has shown that these frogs have an accurate visual image of their surroundings, though it is not known exactly what cues they use for orientation  
(Leenders 2001).  Frogs taken from their burrows and displaced over short distances have managed to return to their burrow in a straight line  
(Leenders 2001). 
 
Adult Leptodactylus pentadactylus are negatively phototactic (avoid light), unlike most anurans  
(Kicliter and Goytia 1995). 
 

","

","
Leptodactylus pentadactylus is not endangered. This species is fairly common (Savage 2002).
","
These frogs have been reported to be occasionally consumed by Amazonian people (Leenders, 2001). 
 
The karyotype is 2N=22 (Bogart 1974).

Most amphibians secrete distasteful or toxic substances from their skin. Several groups wield toxins that can be lethal to other animals, or even to themselves. Animals can evolve resistance to toxins through mutations in proteins that prevent toxins from binding. Although these mutations can provide resistance, they often occur in important regions of a protein, such as those critical to nervous system functions. Thus, a problem arises: how can animals avoid the negative effects of mutations that also provide resistance? A pair of recent studies, one on the toxic salamanders Taricha (Gendreau et al. 2021) and another on frogs of the genus Leptodactylus (Mohammadi et al. 2021), which consume toxic toads, suggest that gene duplication is the key; one gene copy can help animals develop toxin resistance while the other copy maintains a functional nervous system. Both studies also show evidence for a fascinating molecular process known as gene conversion, wherein duplicate copies of one gene retain more similar-than-expected DNA sequences. During homologous recombination, two copies of a genome line up and exchange pieces of DNA; however, when two copies of a gene are near each other in the genome, the wrong genes can line up and exchange genetic material, maintaining genetic similarity between duplicate copies of a gene. In newts, gene conversion appears to have copied resistance-conferring mutations from one gene domain to another. In Leptodactylus frogs, strong natural selection countered the force of gene conversion, resulting in one toxin-resistant gene and one toxin-sensitive gene. How newts and frogs regulate the use of these different gene copies remains unknown and will be an exciting future research topic. (RT)

Heteromorphic sex chromosomes refers to sex chromosomes that differ in appearance and amount of genetic material. The traditional model of species exhibiting heteromorphic sex chromosomes is that they only have two pairs of sex chromosomes. While this is the common model in birds and mammals, amphibians are known to have a greater variation in sex determination from some species not exhibiting heteromorphic sex chromosomes at all to others with the traditional model of pairs. Gazoni et al. (2018) characterized the chromosomes of six female and seven male Leptodactylus pentadactylus, collected from the wild. They found that of the 11 pairs of chromosomes that the species has, more (six) pairs are sex chromosomes than autosomal. Among vertebrates, this is the largest number of sex chromosomes known in a species. Evidence also suggests that L. pentadactylus is part of a larger species complex and their findings may represent the effect of chromosomal rearrangements in the evolutionary process (Written by Ann T. Chang).

Physalaemus barrioi is a small frog (26.2 mm SVL) belonging to the P. gracilis species group (sensu Nascimento et al., 2005). Body elliptical. Head triangular, longer than wide. Snout sub-elliptical in dorsal view and acuminate in lateral view. Maxillary teeth present. A large subgular vocal sac longitudinally folded. Vocal slits present. Tympanum concealed. Supratympanic fold poorly developed. Dorsum with glands arranged in longitudinal folds, along with isolated rounded glands. Rounded inguinal glands not prominent. Arms short. Fingers and toes without fringes or webbing. Second finger longer than first. Finger formula: I, IV,II,III. Nuptial excrescences on thumbs. Enlarged rounded subarticular and supernumerary tubercles on hands and feet. Inner and outer metatarsal conical tubercles well developed in hands and feet. Tarsal tubercle present. Finger and toe tips not expanded. Tarsal fold present (see photo). Toes formula: I,II,V,III,IV (Bokermann, 1967; Provete et al., 2012).
The iris is golden in the upper portion and brown in lateral and lower portions. The inguinal region has contrasting yellow, red, and black colorations. Ocellus in the inguinal gland black, with thin white outline. A reddish coloration is observed in the inguinal region, outer portion of thigh and inner portion of tibia. In some specimens, the dorsum is uniformly dark green instead of dark brown (Provete et al. 2012).

The advertisement call is composed of a single, modulated, non-pulsed note with seven harmonics. The mean duration of the advertisement call is 1.24. The minimum frequency is 2.76 Hz, the maximum frequency is 29.14 Hz, the dominant frequency is at the fifth or sixth harmonic. The interval between calls is 0.39 s. Calls are given at a rate of 1.05 calls per minute (Provete et al., 2012).

Orton type IV tadpole: exotrophic, lentic, benthic. Body ovoid in dorsal view and globular in lateral view. Snout rounded in dorsal and lateral views. Eyes dorsal, dorsolaterally directed. Nares dorsally directed, small, elliptical, with a large dorsally positioned projection on marginal rim. Spiracle single, short, and sinistral, inner wall with indistinct ridge, positioned on the posterior third of the body, just below the median line of the body. Spiracle opening rounded, its opening posterodorsally directed. Vent tube dextral, right wall displaced dorsally and free from ventral fin. Dorsal fin low, but more extensive than the ventral one, emerging at the point of insertion of the caudal musculature. Caudal musculature reaching the tail tip, which is rounded. Oral apparatus anteroventrally oriented, emarginated laterally. Marginal papillae in a single linear row laterally, in alternating rows ventrally. Marginal papillae absent anterodorsally. Jaw sheaths narrow, strongly keratinized, the upper jaw sheath widely arched, curved. Lower jaw sheath U-shaped, wider than the upper one. Upper and lower jaw sheaths finely serrated. Keratinized labial teeth gently curved toward the oral opening. Labial tooth row formula (LTRF) 2(2)/3(1) (Provete et al., 2012). 
","
The only known population of Physalaemus barrioi occurs in the highlands of the Serra da Bocaina, a segment of the Serra do Mar mountain range in Southeastern Brazil (Provete et al., 2012). Adults of P. barrioi breed in permanent marshes in open areas (Provete et al., 2012).  
","
Males call at night from August to February at the base of small thickets and less often during the day after the heavy rains from October to March. Foam nests are found between September and February anchored at the base of marginal vegetation (Provete et al., 2012). Eggs are white. Tadpoles are commonly found in permanent shallow marshes and small ponds with clay bottoms, in open areas with predominantly herbaceous vegetation from October to April and are active during the day (Provete et al., 2012).
","

","
Apparently, P. barrioi is no longer found in the type locality (""Campo de Fruticultura"", currently known as Fazenda Ponte Alta). Specimens occur, however, in other localities within and near the Serra da Bocaina National Park, including Fazenda Bonito (municipality of ArapeÃ­). The type locality has been intensively modified since W. C. A. Bokermann collected the type series (Bokermann 1966). The area was deforested at that time and now supports a secondary forest. Such changes may have resulted in the local extirpation of the species at that location, as currently the species is more commonly found in open montane grasslands in the Serra da Bocaina (Provete et al. 2012).
","

","
Provete et al. (2012) provides a thorough description about this species, including karyotype, larval internal oral features and chondrocranium and should be consulted for more details. It also present an extensive review of advertisement call of Physalaemus species.

Physalaemus centralis belongs to the P. cuvieri species group (Nascimento et al. 2005; Frost 2007), and closely resembles the latter species, but differs from it by its larger size and body width (in dorsal view), the presence of two black spots in the sacral region, and the shorter head. The snout-vent length varies from 30 to 40 mm. Bokermann (1962) did not provide an accurate description, but briefly: Head wide. Tympanum distinct, measuring Â½ of the eye diameter. Supratympanic fold very evident, reaching the base of the arm. Vocal sacs large. Arms strong and small. Subarticular tubercles presents. Tarsal tubercle present. General dorsal color pattern light gray, but can greatly vary to red or cream, with some individuals bearing a granular omega-shaped (&#937;) mark on the dorsum. Throat blackish. Dorsal surface of the members with wide transversal stripes (Bokermann, 1962). It seems not to show sexual dimorphism (Brasileiro and Martins 2006). 

The tadpole was described by Rossa-Feres and Jim (1993). Total length 20 mm at Gosner stage 37. Body ovoid in dorsal view and depressed/globular in lateral view. Snout rounded. Eyes large, dorsolaterally directed. Nares dorsal, small and rounded. Spiracle lateroventral, low on the left side, short and narrow, without free edge. Spiracle tube fused to the body wall, with elliptical opening, directed posteroventrally. Vent tube long, medial and partially fused with the fin. Oral apparatus emarginate laterally, with a single row of marginal papillae with dorsal and lateroventral gap, forming a ventral ridge with a variable number of papillae. Submarginal papillae absent. Jaw sheaths wide. Upper sheaths slightly convex. Lower sheaths widely V-shaped. LTRF 2(2)/2. The internal oral features were thoroughly described by Prado and Rossa-Feres (2005). Tail weakly convex. Caudal muscle heavy. General coloration brown, fins translucent, with marginal dark blotches, concentrated in the posterior third of the tail (Rossa-Feres and Jim 1993, Rossa-Feres and Nomura 2006).

Physalaemus centralis is known from open areas associated with Atlantic semi-deciduous forest, Pantanal and the Cerrado formations of Minas Gerais, Distrito Federal, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, MaranhÃ£o, Tocantins and SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; northeastern Paraguay; Departamento Beni, Bolivia. It occurs up to 1,000m asl. (BrandÃ£o et al. 1997; Kokubum and Menin 2002; Brusquetti and Lavilla 2006; Frost 2007; Brasileiro et al. 2008).
","
Physalemus centralis inhabits open areas and small forest fragments, and is sometimes found at the forest edge as well. Calling males can be found on low vegetation in a short period after heavy rains, associated with small temporary and permanent ponds, farm ponds, farm dams, marshes, puddles, and swamps in riparian areas. It is more abundant in the middle of the rainy season, which usually runs from October to early January (Brasileiro et al. 2005, Vasconcelos and Rossa-Feres 2005, Santos et al. 2007, Zina et al. 2007); Brasileiro and Martins (2006) reported that in the month with the highest abundance, 26 calling males were recorded on average in their study site (a large rectangular fish hatchery tank). 
The species exhibits explosive breeding (Toledo et al. 2003, Vasconcelos and Rossa-Feres 2005, Santos et al. 2007). Amplexus is axillary; the oviposition lasts about 28 min (Brasileiro and Martins 2006). Females lay eggs in small foam nests (mean number of eggs is 1,872) anchored on the marginal vegetation at pond edge or floating on ponds. The tadpoles develop in lentic water bodies (reproductive mode 11 of Haddad and Prado 2005; Toledo et al. 2003; Brasileiro and Martins 2006; Zina et al. 2008). There are records of territoriality and physical combat (Brasileiro 1998). Development takes about one and a half months (Brasileiro and Martins 2006). There is a record of predation of foam nests by adults and maggots of the fly Beckeriella niger (Ephydridae) (Menin and Giaretta 2003). 

The benthic tadpoles are found with highest abundance at the end of the rainy season (Santos et al. 2007) in shallow areas of the water bodies with emerging vegetation and mud (Brasileiro and Martins 2006). Larvae feed mainly on microalgae (Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta) and protozoans (Sarcomastigophora) (Rossa-Feres et al. 2004). The diet of this species was found to be very similar to the co-occurring P. cuvieri tadpoles (Rossa-Feres et al. 2004). 

","

","
Its range is within protected areas, like EstaÃ§Ã£o EcolÃ³gica de Itirapina (SÃ£o Paulo), FEENA  (SÃ£o Paulo), Reserva BiolÃ³gica de Pindorama (SÃ£o Paulo), Floresta Nacional de SilvÃ¢nia (GoiÃ¡s), and EstaÃ§Ã£o EcolÃ³gica de Ãguas Emendadas (Distrito Federal) and others National and State Parks in Brazilian States. The populaton should be stable, since it is widely distributed in central Brazil and is considered a generalist species. However, it is not common, due to its explosive breeding habits (BrandÃ£o and AraÃºjo, 1998, IUCN-GAA, 2004, Vasconcelos and Rossa-Feres, 2005). It does not adapt well to anthropogenic disturbance. It seems that the increasing conversion of natural vegetation in pasturelands and soybean culture, mainly in Central Brazil, may be a possible threat to this species. 


","

","
The karyotype was described by Denaro (1972); the diploid number is equal to 22. 

Pictures of the life cycle of Physalaemus centralis can be found in Brasileiro and Martins (2006). The epithet of this species (centralis) refers to its distribution in central Brazil.

Amphibians of Rio Claro Farm by Fabio Maffei and Flavio Ubaid (2014).

This species was featured in News of the Week 5 June 2023:
Foam nests are a unique reproductive strategy used by frogs providing eggs and larva protection from desiccation, predation, and suffocation while also aiding in fertilization and providing a food source for developing larvae. More recently, the protein and carbohydrate rich foam also has been associated with the vertical transfer of beneficial microbial communities in rhacophorid frogs. Monteiro et al. (2023) characterized the protein composition and microbiome of the nests of three Leptodactylid species: Adenomera hylaedactyla, Leptodactylus vastus, and Physalaemus cuvieri, with each representing a different spawning habitat type. They found that protein composition was species-specific and was influenced more by spawn habitat type and nest size than phylogenetic relatedness. Many of these proteins were previously unidentified. Additionally, the microbiome community of the nest was unique from the surrounding environment and the adult skin microbiome. These findings show that foam nests have a key functional role in reproduction and highlight the need for conservation efforts to protect nests from anthropic pressures, as each nest has a unique microenvironment.

This species was featured in News of the Week 14 August 2023:
Amphibians are found across a wide range of elevations, from sea level to above 5,000 meters, exposing them to a wide range of climates. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that organisms exposed to more temperate variation will be able to function across a wider range of temperatures. Bovo et al. (2023) tested the thermal tolerances of five species of frogs that are distributed across mountains in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest in a variety of microhabitats, including Boana faber, Dendropsophus minutus, Leptodactylus latrans, Physalaemus cuvieri,  and Rhinella icterica. They found differences among species in temperature tolerance, but did not always find that broader temperature variation at increasing elevations correlated with broader temperature tolerance. In addition, they did not find a consistent difference in water loss or water uptake across altitude or climates. Overall, they did not find strong support for the climate variability hypothesis or for elevation shaping these physiological traits. (MWomack)

Physalaemus moreirae is a small frog (SVL 25-7 mm in males, 24.8-28.2 mm in females) that belongs to the P. signifer species group (Nascimento et al. 2005). Snout rounded in profile, tympanum indistinct, weak supratympanic fold, vocal slits present, vocal sac single, slightly expanded externally, extending to border of chest with belly, one pair of brown nuptial pads on each thumb, dorsolateral fold from eye to groin along demarcation of dorsal and flank color, large tear-shaped lumbar gland in groin, narrow portion directed anteriorly, dorsum smooth with scattered low glandular warts, tubercles warty, tubercles most noticeable on upper eyelids, throat and belly smooth, right heel with low glandular tubercle (Heyer 1985; Heyer et al. 1990). Call duration 0.50-0.70 s; calls given frequently when calling; call with harmonics and pulses, call ending with short non-pulsed portion, pulse rate about 50 per s. Dominant frequency range 600-1600 Hz (Heyer 1985; Heyer et al. 1990; Giaretta et al. 2009). 

The tadpole was described in detail by Provete et al. (2011, including internal oral features and chondrocranial morphology. The body is ovoid in dorsal view and depressed in lateral view. Snout rounded. The dorsal fin originates on the body, and is slightly higher than the ventral fin, with maximum height at the middle third. Oral disc antero-ventral, laterally emarginated, with a single row of marginal papillae, alternated ventrally. Submarginal papillae are present ventrally and are usually taller than marginal papillae. The LTRF is 2(2)/3(1).
","
P. moreirae lives in swamps with flowing water inside primary and secondary forests along a narrow extent of the Serra do Mar range in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, southeastern Brazil, up to 1, 200 m asl.
","
Males of P. moreirae can be found calling at night during the rainy season, between August and March (Provete et al. 2011) in swamps or small rivulets inside primary and secondary forests (Heyer et al. 1990), where it builds a foam nest. Tadpoles are benthic and are found in temporary swamps with muddy bottoms (Provete et al. 2011), between October and December. Males apparently occur in low frequency and usually call hidden below dead leaves on the forest floor. More information is needed about the natural history of this species and its habitat requirements.
","

","
The range of this species is within protected areas, such as EstaÃ§Ã£o BiolÃ³gica de BoracÃ©ia, Parque Natural Municipal Nascentes de Paranapiacaba, and Parque das Neblinas. Main threats to P. moreirae are logging and industrial pollution from CubatÃ£o.  
","

","
Originally described by Miranda-Ribeiro (1937), as Engystomops moreirae.  Subsequently, Heyer (1985) described Physalaemus franciscae (named in honor of Francisca Carolina do Val, MZ-USP) from BoracÃ©ia;  P. franciscae was synonymized with P. moreirae by Caramaschi and Caramaschi (1991), who also clarified the type-locality of the species to be Sororocaba, Santos, Brazil.

","
Pleurodema thaul is a small frog with a maximum SVL of 50 mm.  Females are larger than males  
(Diaz-Paez and Ortiz 2001). 
 
  
 Cei (1980) describes this species as follows: ""The skin is smooth, with sparsely distributed flat warts on the back. Its head is slightly wider than large, with a rounded snout and prominent laterally located eyes.  Nostrils are dorsally located, midway between the eye and the tip of the snout. The canthus rostralis is nearly indistinct and the loreal region slants gently to the upper lip. The tympanum is small, and somewhat indistinct. There is a moderate supratympanic fold. Lumbar glands reach to about 1/8 of the body length. The fingers are almost free, with fringes, and the relative finger lengths are 2=4 
 
Dorsally, this frog may be yellow, greenish or dark green, with scattered symmetrical brown spots.  The venter is white or yellow, without spots. There is a bright central black spot on the inguinal gland  
(Cei 1980). 
 
 
The tadpole of P. thaul has a wide, rounded body with a short tail.  The mouth has broad lateral folds, which are surrounded by variable rows of papillae.  There are two wide horny beaks, with tooth rows of 1, 1-1 / 1-1, 2.  The spiracle is lateroventral and sinistral, with the anal opening almost sinistral.  The body color is gray, with a few scattered spots dorsally  
(Cei 1980). 
 

","
Note: Pleurodema thaul is native only to Chile and Argentina.  
Pleurodema thaul occurs up to 2100 m above sea level  
(IUCN 2004). In Chile, the northern end of this frog's range is found near Antofagasta, in the northern arid territories, with a disjunct distribution mainly near rivers such as the Copiapo and Huasco  
(Duellman and Veloso 1977). It occurs down to the southern Nothofagus forest of the Aysen Region of Chile 
(Duellman and Veloso 1977). This species has a wide east-west distribution, from sea level up to the vegetation line of the western slopes of the Central Chilean Andes range  
(IUCN 2004). Pleurodema thaul is also found in the Andean-Antarctic region (Argentina), from Laguna Superior de Epulafquen, Departamento Minas (Neuquen) south to the area between La Plata and Chico lakes, Departamento Rio Senguer (Chubut)  
(Ubeda 2001). It is absent in the Patagonian steppe where it is substituted by Pleurodema bufonina  
(Cei 1980).   
Pleurodema thaul is generally found in Nothofagus forest.  Other habitats include grassland, steppe, and transitional zones, as well as urban and disturbed areas. Adults are found below logs and rocks and within vegetation. Reproduction occurs preferentially in shallow ponds, producing free-swimming larvae, though any type of water body may be used. 
(IUCN 2004). 
Pleurodema thaul also occurs in Araucaria forests in southern Chile and Argentina (Duellman and Veloso 1977). 
 
 

","
The breeding period begins between June and August, and continues until December  
(Diaz-Paez and Ortiz 2001). The reproductive cycle of P. thaul is almost continuous, with gametogenetic activity in males and females during the fall, winter, and spring of the southern hemisphere  
(Diaz-Paez and Ortiz 2001). As in other species of temperate regions, changes in temperature are the main influence on reproduction, followed by changes in rainfall  
(Diaz-Paez and Ortiz 2001).  
Eggs are deposited in strings or gelatinous masses in water, among the aquatic plants filling the lagoons  
(Cei 1980; Duellman and Veloso 1977).  Any body of water may be used, but shallow ponds are preferred. 
 
The mating call of P. thaul is metallic and variable (Cei 1980). Males call from the water surface in marshes, where sound propagation is better than in bogs  
(Penna and Solis 1998).  
Duellman and Veloso (1977) stated that the call consists of a modulated trill having a duration of 0.2 to 9.0 seconds, and that the second (of five) harmonic at about 1500-2300 Hz is dominant. The fourth harmonic at about 5900 Hz is also emphasized  
(Duellman and Veloso 1977). The short call durations given above are for single individuals. In contrast, males calling in large choruses sometimes call continuously for nearly one minute  
(Duellman and Veloso 1977). 
Duellman and Veloso (1977) also reported that a group of four males was observed to have an initially organized chorus structure. One male emitted short, loud, poorly modulated notes followed by the usual mating call. These two kinds of calls had different harmonic structures. As soon as the trill began, the other individuals began trilling  
(Duellman and Veloso 1977). 
This frog's diet consists mostly of a diverse selection of arthropods, with arachnids and dipterids the most common prey, but also includes a small amount of vegetation  
(Diaz-Paez and Ortiz 2003).  
 

","

","
Pleurodema thaul does not appear to be threatened, as it is abundant and ecologically versatile, tolerating a broad range of habitats.  Individual populations may be affected by factors such as habitat burning, water pollution, and drought  
(IUCN 2004). 
 

","
Despite human-induced habitat loss and degradation, Pleurodema thaul appears to thrive in the following artificial habitats: pastureland, plantations; ponds water storage areas, irrigation channels, wastewater treatment areas, open excavations, and irrigated/seasonally flooded agricultural land. It has also adapted to introduced vegetation  
(IUCN 2004). 
 

","
Duellman and Veloso (1977) proposed the separation of P. thaul into different specific entities, but  
Rosset et al. (2001) published a morphometric analysis of Chilean and Argentine P. thaul populations, observing that among other characters, they shared an incised sternum.  
Rosset et al., (2001) reported that their results did not support  
 
Duellman and Velosoâ€™s (1977) conclusion, and that P. thaul is a valid species exhibiting high levels of polymorphism, as previously believed  
(Cei and Capurro 1957; Cei and Espina Aguilera 1957; Cei 1958; Cei 1962; Cei 1980).

A. madagascariensis as previously understood is a complex of various species which occur in different elevational ranges and different areas of eastern Madagascar. The description given here refers to species from mid-elevations that we consider to be typical A. madagascariensis, but a morphological revision of this complex is missing. 

Other forms mentioned in Glaw and Vences (2007) include: 
A. sp. aff. madagariensis ""South"": low-elevation rainforest in Anandohahela National Park; sister lineage of typical A. madagascariensis; habits and calls unknown.
A. sp. aff. madagariensis ""Ranomafana"": from several low-elevation sites in south-eastern Madagascar, from Tolagmaro to Ranomafana where it occurs next to Ranomafana village, while at higher elevations in Ranomafana National Park, typical A. madagascariensis can be found.  It is smaller than typical A. madagascariensis, and breeding males are characterized by a dorsally and ventrally yellow colour with multiple keratinized spines on the ventral side, and distinct nuptial pads.  Near Tolagmaro, calling males were sitting at night on the edge of a pond, and the calls were series of 3-4 pulsed notes.
A. sp. aff. madagariensis ""East"": A further sibling species of A. madagascariensis from eastern coastal habitats.  The only reliable locality for this species is Maroansetra village, where specimens were collected on the sandy ground next to a small spring outside of the breeding season.  The strong molecular differentiation of this species leaves no doubt of its status as separate species.  It is likely that this species also populates other low-elevational habitats on Masoala Peninsula and the east coast.

Observed between 900-2,200m asl. This species lives in rainforests, fields, and disturbed stream sides near slow-moving and stagnant water, rice fields, and degraded sites (Nussbaum et al. 2008).



","
A poor climber, but sometimes found in trees. During day and night in, or near, stagnant or slow-moving water in both forests and ricefields. When touched, specimens may inflate themselves. Both males and females call during day and night. Axillary amplexus was observed in August, and inguinal amplexus has also been reported. 

Habits: Breeds in slow-moving and swampy stretches of sometimes very small streams. In rainforest or in deforested areas in the highlands with some gallery vegetation. Males call at night from hidden positions close to or in the water. 

Calls: Irregularly emitted moaning notes.

Call (from Tsinjoarivo): The only Malagasy frog species for which female calls are reported. One analysed call of a male (recorded during amplexus) consisted of a series of 10 short ""click""-notes, each lasting 20-30 ms, with a ""click-rate"" of about 30/s. Call was repeated at a rate of 60/min during about one minute. Dominant frequency ranged from 0.5 to 1 kHz. The female call is a low buzzing sound, repeated after intervals of about 7 s, with a duration about 500 ms and a frequency upto 1.5 kHz. One male emitted release calls when clasped.

Eggs and tadpoles: 
  Eggs were deposited in clumps of 30, attached to rocks and roots in water. Dissected females contained about 1000 eggs, 2 mm in diameter, coloured dark brown with cream. The brownish tadpoles live in slow-moving water and adjacent pools. Total length in stage 25: 31-61 mm; in stage 41: 73 mm. The mouth is small and directed ventrally. Eyes are directed dorsilaterally. At midlength of the tail, the caudal musculature represents about 1/4-3/10 of the total tail height. Tooth formula is 1/3+3//1+1/2 or 1/4+4//1+1/2. Metamorphosing juveniles can measure 30-32 mm from snout to vent. Their colour is brown or grey with irregular dark brown markings. The venter is yellowish, ventral hindlimb surface is orange. Limbs with distinct transverse bars. A triangular white spot is present both anteriorly and posteriorly of the tympanum.

A green, medium-sized treefrog with snout vent length 35-60 mm; males 
35-40 mm, one female 51 mm. Venter is  bluish to greenish. Skin on the back is smooth. White lateral 
fringes are along lower arm and tarsus. Iris with a 
red ring on the outer iris area. Nostrils are slightly nearer to eye 
than to tip of snout. Tympanum/eye ratio is about 1/2. Tibiotarsal 
articulation reaches tip of snout or beyond. Webbing of the hand: a trace of 
web between finger 1 and 2, 2e(1), 3i(2), 3e(1), 4(1); webbing of the foot 
1(0), 2i(1), 2e(0), 3i(1), 3e(0), 4i/e(1), 5(0). Males are with white nuptial 
pads and a bluish, paired subgular vocal sac. 


Tadpoles  live in flowing water and 
are brownish or blackish-green in late metamorphic stages, with brown or black 
spots on the caudal musculature. The belly is transparent in early stages 
becoming silvery in later stages. Total length in stage 25: 14-28 mm; in 
stages 35-38: 50-65 mm. The mouth is small and directed ventrally. Eyes are 
large and directed laterally. At midlength of the tail, the caudal musculature 
represents about 2/5-1/2 of the total tail height. Tooth formula is 1/5+5//3 
or 1/4+4//3.  

Metamorphosing juveniles measure 18-25 mm from snout to vent. Their colour is 
green with a red spot between the eyes and two lateral yellow lines from the 
tip of the snout, over the eye, to the insertion of the hindlimbs. A second 
tadpole type with a tooth formula of 1/2+2//3 or 1/3+3//3 was also assigned 
to this species. At Tolagnaro only the first form occured.

Ambatolahy forest, Ambohitantely, Andasibe, Andohahela, Itremo, Isalo, Mandraka, Midongy, Nahampoana, Pic St. Louis, Ranomafana (Andranaroa river), Vevembe. It occurs between 300-1,100m asl. This species lives in pristine and degraded rainforest, in secondary vegetation where trees survive, and along streams, where it breeds (Nussbaum et al. 2008).



","
Males call during the evening and night from shrubs, trees and rocks along 
brooks in, and outside of, dense forest; also during dry nights. Couples in 
axillary amplexus have been found in January and March.  

Call: The call is a melodious sound that can last for several minutes. It consists of whistling notes [duration 75 ms (Tolagnaro; 25 Â°C) to 100 ms (Andasibe;18 Â°C)] repeated after short intervals of 40 (25 Â°C) to 90 ms (18 Â°C). Note repetition rate at the two temperatures is 9.3/s and 5.5/s. When beginning to call, males first emit single notes with longer intervals between them; after 
some time they start calling as described above. Frequency ranges from 3 to 
3.5 kHz (Tolagnaro) and 2.7-3.2 (Andasibe). Between the south (Tolagnaro) and 
centre (Andasibe) only minor call differences were found. Another call 
description is generally in accordance with these parameters. When clasped, 
males emit single whistling tones.

Eggs: One female deposited about 200 black, very sticky eggs, with a diameter of 2 mm. At Tolagnaro a clutch that very probably belongs to this species was 
fixed on a vertical stone where fast-running shallow water cascaded down a 
large rock. Egg diameter, including the strong jelly, was 3 mm. After 
separating from the stone, about 120 tadpoles (8 mm total length) hatched. 
A couple from Mandraka (female 51 mm snout vent length) produced a clutch 
of 190 eggs in January; egg diameter was 2.5 mm, including the jelly 4 mm.

A pair was found in axillary amplexus along a stream in 
  woodland, during a rainy night in November. In January, calling males were found 
  after sunset along a brook, about one metre above the ground, near forest. Gravid 
  females with large yellowish eggs were still found in March.

   Call: At Tolagnaro short double-click-notes (duration 60-85 ms) were 
  heard, repeated after intervals of 2800-5400 ms. Frequency ranges from 2.5 to 
  3.5 kHz and note repetition rate is about 0.3/s.

  At Andasibe similar irregularly repeated double-click-notes were also often 
  heard. Beside this call type motivated males displayed a different acoustic 
  repertoire after heavy rainfall in December and January: 1) long series (duration: 
  5000-7000 ms) of many single click notes (note repetition rate about 10/s). 
  Two double-clicks occur at the end of such a series. Frequency is 3.8-4.5 kHz. 
  2) series of about 5 regularly repeated double-click-notes (about 2 such notes 
  per second), possibly with territorial function. 

   Eggs and tadpoles: One female deposited 260 glutinous light green 
  eggs measuring 2 mm in diameter (ref. 89). A female (SVL 34 mm) found in December 
  deposited about 300 yellowish eggs (egg diameter 2 mm, with jelly 3.5 mm. Tadpoles live in slow-running stretches of streams where the water 
  is shaded by abundant vegetation. They are blackish, covered with small bright 
  green spots. Total length in stage 25: 15-27 mm; in stages 31-41: 28-36 mm. 
  The eyes are directed laterally. The mouth is small and directed ventrally. 
  At midlength of the tail, the caudal musculature represents about 2/5 of the 
  total tail height. Tooth formula is 1/3+3//1+1/2 or 1/2+2//1+1/2. Metamorphosis 
  occurred in November; juveniles measure 11.5-14.0 mm SVL

Habits: The habits and calls of typical G. malagasius from low elevations along the east coast are unknown. Information previously assigned to G. malagasius in fact refers to the following species which is now known to be genetically distinct from east coast populations.  Males were observed calling at night in rainforest, close to the ground and more than 10 m away from a stream. 


Call (from Andasibe): A single, long, pulsed note. Note duration is 920-1440 ms, one note consists of 26 pulses, pulse repetition rate is 28/s. Calls are regularly repeated after intervals of 750-800 ms (call repetition rate 30/min). Frequency is 2.5-4.5 kHz. Calls from Ankeniheny (23.5Â°C) are similar: Call repetition rate 26-30/min, pulses per note 18, intervals between pulses 30-80 ms, pulse repetition rate 21/s. Calls from Marojezy are somewhat different: Call repetition rate is lower (15/min), note duration shorter (460 ms), intervals between pulses shorter (21-23 ms), pulse repetition rate higher (42/s; about 20 pulses per note); rarely a very long call was heard (call duration 2000 ms, consisting of about 75 pulses); frequency is 3-4.5 kHz.

This species is listed as near threatened because its Extent of Occurrence is probably not much greater than 20,000 km2, and the extent and quality of its habitat are probably declining, thus making the species close to qualifying for Vulnerable. It occurs in Parc National de Ranomafana, and perhaps in Parc National dâ€™Andohahela, however, it is threatened by the loss and degradation of its forest habitat due to subsistence agriculture, timber extraction, charcoal manufacture, invasive spread of eucalyptus, livestock grazing and expanding human settlements (Glaw and Vences 2008).

A generally small and stout Mantella frog, body length 19-24 mm, females rarely can reach up to 31 mm. Dorsally uniformly yellow-orange, in some populations red-orange, often with a translucent shade. Bright red flashmarks present. Iris nearly uniformly black, only a little light pigment in its upper part. Ventrally uniform, similar to dorsal surface but generally somewhat lighter, except red flashmark (extended nearly on the whole tibia). Some inner organs visible through the slightly transparent ventral skin. 

The colouration of M. aurantiaca is unique and not easily confused with other species.

Andranomandry, Andranomena, Torotorofotsy. It occurs between 920-960m asl in primary and secondary rainforest and usually damp, swampy areas, often associated with screw pine (Pandanus) forest (Vences et al. 2008). 

","
The occurrence of this species is correlated with humid Pandanus forest, where it can be found in sun-exposed sites (Glaw and Vences 2006). Here Mantella aurantiaca can be heard calling from the ground, among vegetation in swampy areas (Glaw and Vences 2006). It is active during the day (Blommers-SchlÃ¶sser and Blanc 1991; Glaw and Vences, pers. obs.).

Calls: Irregular series of short chirping notes. The call (from Andasibe) consists of a series of short notes (duration 50-60 ms). An oscillogram of one note shows that it consists of 3 very short clicks. Frequency ranges from about 4.5-6.5 kHz, dominant frequency is about 5.3kHz. Another analysis confirms that notes consist of 3 clicks, but shows a frequency band between 3 and 7 kHz (Glaw and Vences 1994; Ahl 1929).  The call has also been described as an irregular succession of short chirps (Glaw and Vences 2006).


Eggs and tadpoles (from near Andasibe): Eggs are deposited in moist leaf litter outside of water. One clutch consists of 20-60 whitish eggs (diameter 1.5-2mm). Embryogenesis lasts 14 days and the tadpoles are flooded into small pools by heavy rain. The tadpoles develop within about 70 days into froglets measuring 11 mm (Glaw and Vences 1994).  Frogs of the genus Mantella are sexually mature within a year after metamorphosis and thus have short generation times (Glaw et al. 2000).  

The adult colouration is probably aposematic, as M. aurantiaca contains a variety of toxins in the skin, including pumiliotoxin, allopumiliotoxin and homopumiliotoxin alkaloids, as well as pyrrolizidines, indolizidines and quinolizidines (Daly et al. 1984, 1996; Garraffo et al. 1993).  This toxicity is derived from dietary sources, as is the case with dendrobatid frogs (Daly et al. 1997).  Captive-bred M. aurantiaca lack toxicity when fed non-toxic arthropods, but readily accumulate alkaloids when fed alkaloid-dusted fruit flies (Daly et al. 1997). 


","

","
Endangered status: area of occupancy is probably less than 10km2. Its distribution is severely fragmented, and the extent of its forest habitat in east-central Madagascar is declining, and the number of mature individuals might also be declining through over-exploitation.It does not occur in protected areas, but it is found near to the RÃ©serve SpÃ©ciale dâ€™Analamazaotra. This species is being maintained in captivity by about 35 zoos and other institutions and is being bred in captivity by public institutions and many private individuals (Vences et al. 2008).
","
This species is collected for the pet trade and is commonly bred in captivity (Glaw et al. 2000). Commercial export of M. aurantiaca began in the late 1980s or early 1990s, but was halted in 2002 (CITES Secretariat 2008).  Import of wild-caught specimens to the European Union has been banned since 2006 (CITES Secretariat 2008).  There is thought to be little illegal trade of wild-caught specimens owing to the low price paid to Malagasy collectors plus the high sensitivity of mantellas to transport conditions (CITES Secretariat 2008).

Male frogs vocalize for several reasons: defense of territories, sexual selection (such as male-male competition, female mate choice), and can provide information about the male's physical condition. Thus, the ability of a male or female frog to recognize calls of its own species is important to the survival of populations. To test recognition of a call, researchers can use phonotaxis experiments, in which the movement responses of individuals to the male call are recorded and analyzed. Passos et al. (2022) studied the phonotactic responses of wild and captive (zoo-reared) male Golden Mantella frogs (Mantella aurantiaca) to both wild and captive playback calls of the same species to determine the impact of captivity on phonotactic behavior. They found that wild males had a similar response to calls from wild and captive males whereas captive males had a significantly stronger response to calls of captive conspecifics. They conclude that lack of appropriate response by captive frogs to the calls of wild conspecifics could have negative consequences for conservation efforts if captive-reared frogs were released to the wild. Although male-male interactions are important in mating, it remains unknown how captive females respond to wild vs captive calls. Their response would likely be more relevant to successful reproduction. (Written by David Cannatella)

Medium-sized species with slender appearance. 22-29 mm. Head and anterior part of dorsum covered by a sharply delimited yellow/green marking, posteriorly either ending semicircularly or prolonged as a pointed triangle to the cloacal region (not corresponding to sexual dimorphism). Flanks and posterior part of dorsum black. Arms and legs usually black, rarely copper brown. Hands and finger tips often with blue spots. No frenal stripe, but single yellowish spots sometimes present under the eyes. Iris black without light pigment. Venter with small blue or greyish spots, throat generally black without pattern. No red, orange or yellow pattern on hindlimbs. 

Similar species: M. betsileo, M. viridis and M. expectata differ by having blue spots on the throat, less extended terminal finger disks and usually a light line along the upper lip. Mantella sp. is similar in colouration but lacks extended finger disks and has a frenal stripe.

Ambavala, Ambodimanga (Mananara), Folohy, Marojejy, Nosy Mangabe, Tsararano. It occurs from sea level to 600m asl in rainforest, bamboo forest, and other types of forest with abundant tree holes (in which it breeds) (Andreone and Vences 2008).

","
Habits: Adults were found on the forest floor, climbing up to 4 m on trees, and in water-filled tree-holes or bamboo nodes. In these tree-holes up to six (but mostly two) adults were present together. When disturbed they often submerged underwater. Aggressive behaviour was not observed. Height of the tree-holes ranged from 10-350 cm above the forest floor, and tree-hole size was very variable (depth up to 30 cm, diameter 3-12 cm). Calls were heard throughout the day. No individuals were heard or found at night, neither on the ground nor in the tree-holes. Sympatric species found in the same tree-holes were Platypelis grandis, Plethodontohyla notosticta and Anodonthyla boulengeri. Stomachs of dissected specimens contained many small ants and termites, and some flies. Reproduction is unique among Mantella: Rather large white eggs are deposited singly 1-2 cm above the water surface of tree-holes (not protected against daylight). Sometimes eggs dry out with descending water-levels and some eggs disappear. Embryonic development is visible two days after egg-laying. Eggs found underwater on the bottom did not show any development. Eggs were observed in October and March. This fact indicates, as well as the different sizes of tadpoles and juveniles, an extended breeding period. Tree-holes were populated by one tadpole, or by two tadpoles in different developmental stages. The tadpoles have a reduced number of labial denticles and a strong horny beak. They feed on fertilized conspecific eggs or are actively fed by the mother with unfertilized eggs. Occasionally they might eat the eggs of other frog species (especially the treehole-breeding cophylines). In the absence of eggs, tadpoles are omnivorous. 

Calls: Series of short double-click notes, similar to species of the M. betsileo group. 
","

","
Near Threatened: extent of occurrence is probably not much greater than 20,000 km2, and the extent and quality of its habitat are probably declining, thus making the species close to qualifying for Vulnerable. This species occurs in several protected areas, and is also maintained and bred in several facilities outside Madagascar (Andreone and Vences 2008).

 Parenting is an uncommon strategy among amphibians to raise offspring, and rarely takes the form of intense care compared to other vertebrates. For example, when species diversified and gained new niches to avoid competition for the same resources, maternal provisioning provides evolutionary benefits to surpass the cost of reduced access to nutrients. Fischer et al. 2019 demonstrated that in addition to supplying nutrients to offspring living in small isolated pools of water, maternal provisioning of unfertilized eggs is a way of passing along chemical defenses in some aposematic and poisonous frogs species. This mechanism of toxin transfer convergently evolved in two distant clades of frogs living in the antipodes, the Malagasy Climbing Mantella (Mantella laevigata) and the Ecuadorian Little Devil Poison Frog (Oophaga sylvatica), which diverged roughly 140 million years ago. Further, they showed that the neuronal basis of their maternal behavior relies on similar brain region activities but with distinct activation patterns, suggesting an evolutionary versatility in the molecular mechanisms sustaining maternal provisioning (Written by Alexandre Roland).

Leptobrachium montanum is a stocky frog with a broad head and snout-vent length in females of about 87 mm and in males about 65 mm. The snout comes to a rounded tip, with a slight fold from the nostrils to the upper lip. It has large eyes and a fairly large canthus. The pupil is small and vertical, with the longitudinal diameter of the upper eyelid equal to the interorbital space. There is a glandular fold from the base of the eye to the ear. The nostrils are close in proximity and inconspicuous. It has a large, almost circular shaped tongue. The forelimbs are skinny and longer in relation to the hind legs. The second finger is slightly thickened towards the tip and is longer than the first. The back has a small indentation. The dorsal and ventral skin has a smooth texture (Fischer 1885).

Leptobrachium montanum is morphologically similar to Leptobrachium gunungensis. Both frogs belong to the family Megophryidae and are considered sibling species. These two species can be distinguished slightly by distribution and more notably by their distinct calls (see Life History section; Malkmus 1996).

The dorsal surfaces are brown and appear to be reticulated. There are black-fringed round spots irregularly scattered on the dorsum. The limbs may have black bands and white or pale yellow dot-like spots. The belly is lighter than the dorsum, and may be grayish with bright yellow dots concentrated in the chin and throat area. Outside the iris, the eye sclera is white (Fisher 1885).

The tadpoles have a strong tail with a well-developed caudal fin. The snout of the tadpoles is long and blunt. The tail is patterned with dark spots. As the tadpole ages and develops, the number of dark spots on the tail increases until the body color is darker in general (Nodzenski et al. 1989).

","
This species is endemic to Borneo. It can be found within the countries of Indonesia and Malaysia. It is primarily found within the states of Sabah and Sarawak. It has an altitudinal range of 900 m up to 1800 m where these frogs live in tropical montane and submontane forests. They are able to withstand the cooler nighttime temperatures (Inger and Tan 1996). 
","
Leptobrachium montanum is abundant in numerous localities (Inger et al. 2004). When feeling threatened, the frogs will crouch within leaf litter and mimic dead leaves (Manthey and Grossmann 1997).

The advertisement call of L. montanum is a loud â€˜quakâ€™, which sounds similar to a duck quack (Fischer 1885). The species breeds in small streams of montane forests where the larvae develop within small pools of breeding streams (Inger et al. 2004). The tadpoles are large with bulky bodies (>70 mm) and are more active during the night, although they can be seen during the day (Nodzenski et al. 1989).

O. chuanbeiensis has been found in two locations: Ping Wu and Maoxian counties in northern Sichuan province, between 1300 and 2000 m in elevation  (IUCN 2006). It inhabits ravines and the surrounding forest  
(Fei 1999). 
","
Outside of breeding season, O. chuanbeiensis is terrestrial. In the morning, these toads hide in the damp, moist soil of holes or in the crevices between rocks. At night, they become active, often crawling or hopping for short distances.

O. jingdongensis occurs in Jingdong, Shuangbai and Xingping counties in southwestern Yunnan province, between 1500 to 2450 meters above sea level. The species is not extremely rare (IUCN 2006)[3767]. It inhabits high mountain areas, frequently in mixed evergreen and broadleaf forests  
(Fei 1999). 
","
Outside of breeding, these toads live on land, dispersed in the forest. Adults gather in the stream in a ten-day period between the end of February and the middle of March and breed beneath the rocks. The female lays about 170 eggs which are stuck to the undersides of rocks. Eggs are 3.4-3.8 mm in diameter and milky yellow. The shape of the egg mass is highly variable, with some eggs joined in sheets. Many tadpoles live in slow-flowing streams, where rocks are relatively plentiful. In the morning they often hide under rocks or rotten leaves. When disturbed they will quickly swim away. At night they emerge and are active, swimming sluggishly (Fei 1999)[617].

O. liangbeiensis is native to China, found only in a small streams in Puxiong, Yuexi County, in southern Sichuan province (IUCN 2004). It lives at an altitude of 2850 to 3000 meters above sea level in the high mountainous, mixed broadleaf and coniferous forest where rainfall is plentiful. The environment is cool, shady and wet, with dense vegetation (Fei, 1999)[617]. 
","
During the day, O. liangbeiensis hides below stones on the stream bank. If disturbed, it will rapidly swim to deep water and hide in between the stones. During May, adults enter the stream to spawn. Females produce 350 eggs, laying them on the underside of stones in ring-like clusters. After spawning season, the adults will separate and disperse throughout the forest, living both on land and in water. Tadpoles live in between rocks in the stream where the current is slow. They are not easily found as they only occur in small groups (Fei, 1999)[617].  

","

","
The known population is composed of less than 100 individuals and continues to decline. The primary threat to O. liangbeiensis is habitat loss caused by logging and hill fires. Deforestation has also resulted in reduced rainfall, causing many streams to dry up (IUCN 2004).

O. lichuanensis occurs in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou and Chongqing Provinces, between 1790 and 2300 meters above sea level. It is not commonly found (IUCN 2006)[3767]. This species inhabits brushy areas adjacent to small streams along slopes beneath tall broadleaf forest  
(Fei 1999). 
","
These toads are terrestrial until the middle of April. During the following 10-day period, adults enter the stream to breed. The female lays approximately 215 eggs that stick to the underside of submerged rocks. Eggs are 3.5-3.8 mm and milky white. The egg masses are ring-like in shape or linked in sheets. Tadpoles disperse in backwater pools or under rocks in quiet streams. They move sluggishly, and if disturbed they will hide in the deep water, in the crevices between rocks (Fei 1999)[617]. 

","

","
The major threat to the species is rapid habitat loss, due principally to logging (IUCN 2006).

A  stout, globular frog, with a snout-vent length of about 40-50 mm. This species is sexually dimorphic, with females tending to be larger than males. Head very small. Nuchal fold present. Tympanum concealed. Foreleg short, reaching the middle of the body when adpressed. Hindleg very short. Fingers and toes roundish and free. Skin smooth. Olive-brown above, spotted with dorsal and lateral dark irregular blotches, belly dark scattered with pale yellow spots (Parker 1934; Cochran 1955; Cei 1980). This species releases a whitish skin secretion that can have antiparasitic and antifungal activities (Tempone et al. 2007). 


","
This species is found in Paraguay; Corrientes and central and southern Chaco provinces in Argentina; the states of SÃ£o Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, GoiÃ¡s, CearÃ¡, Tocantins, Bahia, MaranhÃ£o, PiauÃ­, ParaÃ­ba, in Brazil; and Southeastern Bolivia (IUCN 2006). Dermatonotus muelleri generally lives in open formations, though occasionally it can be found inside forest fragments (Silva and Rossa-Feres 2007) and near man-made facilities in urban areas (Ãvila and Ferreira 2004).  It occurs at elevations up to 1,500 m above sea level (IUCN 2006).  
","
Like other microhylid frogs, it lives below ground. It feeds on termites and Isoptera. This species is an explosive breeder (Wells 1977), with reproduction occurring from September-November through February. Frequently, the breeding activity lasts 5 days. During the breeding period, the abundance of calling males can reach one thousand individuals. Oviposition takes place in water bodies (sometimes in farm ponds) in the shallows, with or without vegetation. A detailed description of the natural history and reproductive biology of this species can be found in Nomura (2003). 

The tadpole is exotrophic and a suspension feeder, consuming algae (Baccilariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Dinophyceae). Euglenoids have also been found alive and undamaged in the intestinal contents of D. muelleri tadpoles (EcheverrÃ­a and Conforti 2000).

Adults may be eaten by marsupials, birds, dogs, and snakes (Nomura 2003). 

","
The tadpole has no nares. The snout is rounded and truncate, and the body is rounded dorsally and depressed laterally. Eyes are lateral and small. The oral disc is absent, and keratinized mouthparts and papillae are both lacking.  A dermal flap is present in front of the mouth, but the flap does not have jagged edges. The spiracle is ventral, as well as long and wide. The vent is short and medial and fused with the ventral fin. Both dorsal and ventral fins are low and convex. Dorsal fin rises at a low slope from the body-tail junction. Tail sheath is present. 

The coloration of the tadpole is reddish-brown in dorsal view and whitish in ventral view, with translucent, slightly pigmented fins (Rossa-Feres and Nomura 2006). A detailed description of the tadpole's external morphology can be found in Vizotto (1967), Cei (1980), Lavilla (1992), Altig and McDiarmid (1999), and Rossa-Feres and Nomura (2006), with the latter commenting on some of the discrepancies between larval morphology descriptions by different authors. A description of the chondrocranium can be found in Lavilla (1992). The internal oral morphology was described by EcheverrÃ­a and Lavilla (2000).

","
The population appears to be stable. This is a common species within its range, though generally hard to find due to its burrowing habits (IUCN 2006). 
","
There are some breeding facilities that sell this species as a pet. 
","
This species is monotypic, having a single species in the genus.

Studies of reproduction associated with skin glands among frogs are rare. However, work by Antoniezi et al. (2022) on Muellerâ€™s Termite Frog (Dermatonotus muelleri) â€“ a Brazilian microhylid known for its toxic skin secretion â€“ showed that this species possesses poison glands that are uncommon among frogs: they are very large, elongated, one juxtaposed to the other, and occupying a considerable part of the dermal volume. The authors further showed that in males, adhesive glands were observed in the dorsum of the forefoot, ventral forearm, as well as the pectoral and anterior ventral regions. The disposition of such glands seems to compensate for the round and short forelimbs of Dermatonotus muelleri during amplexus through an axillary embrace. Their work contributes to our knowledge of skin gland diversity especially with respect to reproduction. (Written by Umilaela Arifin)

Kaloula pulchra ranges in size from 54-70 mm SVL for males, and 57-75 mm SVL for females. The body is stocky, with a small head and short, rounded snout. This frog will inflate itself when threatened.

The dorsum is dark brown, sometimes with irregular yellowish-brown spots. A narrow dark lateral stripe is present from the rear of the eye almost to the groin.  This lateral stripe is separated from the mid-dorsal dark brown coloration by a thick yellow or orange stripe, which may itself be punctuated with several spots. The belly is mottled dirty yellowish brown. Males have a black throat.     
","
This species is found in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Taiwan (introduced), Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore (introduced), Sri Lanka, Thailand, Viet Nam, Guam (introduced), and the Philippines (introduced) (Lazell and Lu 1996; Christy et al. 2007). It is found in wetland, riverbank, and forest edge habitats, as well as agricultural and residential areas, at elevations up to 750 m a.s.l. It breeds in seasonal rain pools or ponds (Kuangyang et al. 2004).
","
Generally breed during rainy season; males are usually heard during and after rainfall. They otherwise hide under burrows or vegetation and are nocturnal (Emerson 1976). Calls can be given while males float on the water surface. Calling is usually in chorus; however, adjacent calling males may alternate their calls (Kanamadi et al. 2002). 

These frogs prey on ants (Berry 1965).  

K. pulchra can exude highly sticky secretions, which are most likely used to deter predators (Evans and Brodie 1994). These secretions are noxious (unpleasant tasting) but did not contain detectable levels of toxins when tested (Daly et al. 2004).
","

","
This frog is adaptable and appears to be increasing in numbers (Kuangyang et al. 2004).
","
Kaloula pulchra is collected for local consumption as well as the international pet trade. It has been accidentally introduced to several countries  (e.g., Guam), presumably via maritime or air-transport vessels and the pet trade. One specimen was discovered at the Perth airport in 2005 (Tyler and Chapman 2007), and one found in cargo at a New Zealand wharf (Gill et al. 2001), but there are no records showing the species has become established in either Australia or New Zealand. It often takes advantage of urban environments where it can be quite abundant (Kuangyang et al. 2004).

","
Metaphynella sundana, or the Borneo tree-hole frog, is a member of the microhylid family. It is a small, stocky bodied frog ranging from 19 - 22.5 mm snout-vent length with short limbs. The head of M. sundana is as wide as long and the nose is pointed and longer than the diameter of the eye. The interorbital distance is 1.6 - 2.0 times as wide as the upper eyelid. The tympanum is hidden by a curved supratympanic fold extending from the eye to the axilla.  The toes of M. sundana have slightly enlarged tubercles. The fourth toe has only two tubercles. Metaphrynella sundana lacks an outer metatarsal tubercle, and possesses only a small inner metatarsal tubercle, which is oval in shape. The feet have extensive webbing that extends beyond the basal tubercles and leaves only the distal phalanx free of webbing on all but the fourth toe, which has 2 or 3 web-free phalanges. The first finger is shorter than the second (Inger 1966) and the fifth finger is longer than the third (Matsui et al. 1996). The toe pads of M. sundana are truncate and are adhesive (Matsui et al. 1996). Males lack nuptial pads and possess vocal sacs with slit-like openings on the sides of the floor of the mouth. Its skin is tubercular, with the tubercles on its sides being larger (Inger 1966). 

Coloration ranges from light to dark brown, with darker blotches and patterning dorsally. Some specimens have dark crossbars on the dorsal side of the limbs. Individuals may be ventrally solid colored or splotched, with white or dark spots in some (Inger 1966). 

In alcohol, M. sundana has grey or brown dorsal coloration with dark irregular markings. Ventrally the frog has dark mottling and a solid black or grey with black spotted throat. Dorsal limb coloration may show crossbars (Inger 1966).
","
Metaphrynella sundana is a terrestrial frog endemic to the rainforests of Borneo. It is usually found at 200 m in elevation and prefers flat, low-lying areas (Inger 1966; Lardner and Lakim 2004).
","
Males call from pools of water that collects in tree holes 1 - 5 m above the ground. They are territorial, and only one male occupies a single tree hole. Males are able to determine the resonance properties of the tree hole they are calling from and adjust their calls to maximize the amplitude of their call. They attract mates with a short, tonal pulse. The males can be heard up to 50 m away. Females prefer calls that are in the lower range of frequencies (Clark 2002; Lardner and Lakim 2004). During the non-seasonal breeding period, females lay their eggs, 1 mm in size (Inger 1966), in the tree hole. These hatch into tadpoles, which develop within the tree hole (Lardner and Lakim 2002 and 2004). 
","

","
While Metaphrynella sundana is listed as â€˜Least Concernâ€™, it is threatened by deforestation of rainforest habitat. In general, the species is widely distributed and assumed to have a large population size. (Inger 2004).
","

","
Metaphrynella is included in the subfamily Microhylinae with other taxa such as Kaloula and Microhyla (Inger 1966; Matsui et al. 1996).

This species has a small head and body.  M. ornata has no teeth and the tympanum cannot be seen.  The tips of the fingers are swollen and the webbing is poorly developed.  The skin on the back of this species is smooth but contains random granules.  The mean snout to vent length for males is 24 mm (range 22-26) and for females 28 mm (range 24-32).  The males lack nuptial pads and have dark patches on their throats.  A groove extends from the back of the eye to the arm.

The SVL is about 20-40 mm. General aspect globulose, skin smooth. Head very small and pointed, triangular when viewed from above, snout very prominent, projecting well beyond mouth and with a rounded tip, tympanum not visible, eyes very small, nostrils lateral. Vocal sac distinct in males. Arms short, forearms stout; palm thick, two faint metacarpal tubercles of which the outer is larger; digits cylindrical, unwebbed, and without lateral fringes; hind limb and foot short and stout, with a single inner indistinct metatarsal tubercle; tips of toes simple (no terminal discs), fingers and toes unreduced (Miranda-Ribeiro 1926; Parker 1934; Cochran 1955; Nelson and Lescure 1975). Carvalho (1954) described some osteological aspects and made taxonomic comments. 


The dorsal color is dark brown with small whitish dots and the belly is light brown colored in life (Miranda-Ribeiro 1926; Parker 1934; Cochran 1955; Nelson and Lescure 1975). The posterior surface of the thigh is mottled (Heyer et al. 1990). 
","
The species is distributed along the Atlantic Rain Forest in the Serra do Mar and Mantiqueira Mountain Range in the States of SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, southern EspÃ­Â­rito Santo and eastern Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, above 1,100 m. Myersiella microps lives beneath ground and on leaf litter, inside woodlands and at the forest edge (Feio et al. 2003; Martins and Junqueira 2004; Frost 2007).

","
Myersiella microps, like other microhylids, is fossorial and uses its very pointed snout to dig. This species is active at night or day in the beginning of the rainy season from August to March, with low frequency in June and July (Hartmann et al. 2002; Dixo and Verdade 2006). Lutz (1954) reported M. microps from burrows on the forest floor. At TinguÃ¡ (Nova IguaÃ§u-RJ), individuals were found under moist leaf litter at the bases of large tree buttresses and rocks and were observed walking on the surface in a light rain shortly after dark. The diet includes ants (Nelson and Lescure, 1975). 

Myersiella microps shows explosive breeding. Males call from the ground and under the roots of small shrubs on the forest floor, away from water bodies (Izechsohn et al. 1971; Hartmann et al. 2002). The advertisement call consists of a long clear frequency-modulated note with energy concentrated between 2.4 and 2.6 kHz (Hartmann et al. 2002) and can be heard on Haddad et al. (2003). 

Amplexus is pelvical. Eggs are large (7 mm in diameter) and are laid in small cavities in leaf litter and tree boles. The clutch size is small, with a mean of 14 eggs per clutch. This species has direct development, with embryos developing directly into froglets.  Development lasts about 19 days (Izechsohn et al. 1971). One female was found lying upon the egg clutch soon after its deposition on the ground, suggesting parental care (Izecksohn et al., 1971; Izecksohn and Carvalho-e-Silva, 2001). 
","

","
Its range is within protected areas, like the Nova Baden State Park, at Lambari-MG (Sacramento 2004), Ibitipoca State Park, at Lima Duarte-MG (Feio 1990), Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar, Picinguaba-SP (Hartmann et al. 2002), RPPN Fazenda Lagoa, in Monte Belo-MG (Garey and Silva, unpublished manuscript) and Parque Nacional da Tijuca, in Rio de Janeiro-RJ (Izecksohn and Carvalho-e-Silva 2001). Declining according to IUCN (2006).

","
Scaphiophryne gottlebei is a small to medium conspicuously coloured frog, characterised by a typical white, reddish, greenish and black dorsal pattern, rounded morphology, and greyish belly. Borders between all colors very distinct. Typically, the females are bigger (30-40 mm), and also have a brighter and more contrasted colouration, than males. Males are smaller (20-30 mm), and are generally paler than females.  Skin on the back smooth. Tympanum indistinct. The snout is very short, the mouth is small, the eyes are prominent, and the legs are relatively short. The hindlimbs are quite robust, and the underside of the foot displays a typical horny metatarsal tubercle, which is used by this frog to burrow. The hands also have typical claws, which permit the frog to cling to the vertical stony walls of the canyons within which it lives. Hands are characterised by the presence of large digital expansions. Tips of toes not enlarged. Fingers without webbing, toes with a well developed web.  
 
Scaphiophryne gottlebei is unique in colouration. The other Scaphiophryne species, except for S. marmorata and S. boribory, do not have enlarged fingertips. Scaphiophryne gottlebei is syntopic with S. brevis and S. calcarata. 
 
 
 
 

","
Type locality: Isalo Massif (VallÃ©e des Singes; actually known as VallÃ©e des Makis), in south-central Madagascar.  Also found in surrounding areas, including Ilalaka and the PN de Isalo. Within the rocky, montane part of the Isalo Massif, this species is found in narrow, sandy-bed canyons with vertical rock walls.  The habitat is dark, cool (19-22 degrees C), and humid (close to 100%).  Vegetation is absent or limited to occasional trees. 

Surprisingly until recently the species â€“ although intensively collected for the pet trade - had a poorly known distribution. The recent survey work carried out by one of us (FA), in collaboration with V. Mercurio, Jasmin E. Randrianirina, and Gennaro Aprea, allowed to confirm the presence of the species in the Isalo Massif and nearby areas. There, we found it outside the protected area, in the Ilakaka surroundings, from which most of the animals are captured for the pet-trade. Furthermore, we also found it at several sites within the PN de lâ€™Isalo. There, S. gottlebei was already known for the Canyon des Makis (from which the type series came). Surprisingly enough, it seems that within this canyon the species is very rare, or even not regularly present. The habitat appears not suitable for the species' reproduction, and we believe that its presence (if the collecting information provided within the description work were correct) was very casual, and possibly due to the occasional finding of erratic specimens. 

After our surveys carried out in 2004 (January-February and November-December), we are quite convinced that S. gottlebei is present almost anywhere in the rocky Isalo Massif. The preferred habitat is represented by typical narrow canyons. These canyons host a cool and wet atmosphere, which is quite stable in temperature, contrasted to the â€œexternalâ€ savannas, which are subject to strong seasonal and day/night thermal excursions. During the rainy season (October to February)  these canyons become temporary fast running streams. After the rainfall the water remains in small pools within the rocks. There S. gottlebei breeds and completes its larval development. We also found the species outside these canyons, where it is likely that it finds refuge under rocks and in deep crevices.   
 
 
 
 
 

","
On the occasion of the 2004 survey (which was sponsored by the Nando Peretti Foundation), I had the chance to witness some peculiar behaviours and life history traits of this species. So far, it seems that it leads two kinds of life. First, it has a typical fossorial life style, which is shared by most of the species belonging to the genus Scaphiophryne. Using its robust hindlegs and horny metatarsal tubercle, S. gottlebei digs in the sand or other soft substrate available in its natural habitat. Second, it also has a scansorial life style, witnessed in this by the presence of largely expanded fingertips. We observed on several occasions overnight active specimens which jumped on the vertical canyonâ€™s walls, and indeed were able to climb at several meters from the ground. This also allowed the frogs to find refuges in small holes present on the walls, and caused by the loss of chalks from the karstic matrix. 

Calling males were found swimming at the water surfaces of pools from recent rain, or clinging to rocky surfaces. The call itself consists of 20 seconds of short, discordant notes at constant intensity, similar to that of other Scaphiophryne species (Andreone, Mattioli and Mercurio 2005).  The call ranges in frequency from 500-1400 Hz and has a note repetition rate of 32â€“36 notes/s (Andreone, Mattioli, and Mercurio 2005).
","
The tadpole has a robust, ovoid body with a flattened ventrum. The snout is trapezoidal with nares in a shallow, light-colored furrow and located closer to the eyes than to the tip of the snout. Nares do not open until stage 41. Dorsolateral eyes.  Rounded oral disc surrounded by dense marginal and submarginal conical-shaped papillae, sometimes pigmented except for tips.  Labial teeth lacking; well-developed jaw sheath, with lower jaw sheath partially pigmented underneath.  Tail fins relatively high, with ventral fin higher than dorsal. Spiracle ventrolateral, opening to posterior, and vent tube ventrally directed with medial opening (Mercurio and Andreone 2006). 

The background color of tadpoles transforms from gray-brown at night to black in the daytime. All surfaces are scattered with melanophores which increase in density on the dorsal and lateral posterior surfaces. There is a translucent diamond-shaped area between the eyes. The tail fins are also transparent with dark edges. Tadpoles begin to take on the adult coloration pattern near metamorphosis. Metamorphs are 10-15 mm long and less conspicuous than adults but with similar white, red, and black designs (Mercurio and Andreone 2006).

Behaviour: Tadpoles live in the temporary rocky pools, and most likely have a very fast development. Indeed, the strong water course which forms after rainfalls literally wipes away any tadpole present there and excludes the possibility to have completed the metamorphosis. At Ilakaka and Isalo we found metamorphosing tadpoles (with only a portion of the tail, and already having contrasting back colouration) in late January. Taking into consideration the large number found also in a sub-optimal season, we believe that the species is very abundant during the rainy season. We also found many tadpoles in the pools during November-December.  Metamorphosis appears to take about 2-3 months (Mercurio and Andreone 2006). 

The feeding behavior of the tadpoles is unique. During the day, they stay close to the pool bottom and often burrow into the sandy, muddy substrate, such that the head is almost buried in the substrate and the tail is projecting out at a 30-45Â° angle. This position allows the tadpoles to feed on substrate particles.  In all collected tadpoles, the intestine was completely filled with detritus.  At night, the tadpoles leave the bottom to swim around in the water column, apparently filter-feeding on suspended particles, and occasionally reaching the surface for air. 

Due to the unique feeding habits and physical characteristics of these tadpoles, a new ecomorphological category has been proposed, ""psammonektonic."" Psammonektonic tadpoles are active both by day and by night, have keratinized mouthparts and papillae, dorsolateral eyes, a ventrolateral spiracle, and have dual feeding modes: filter-feeding within the water column and direct substrate ingestion via active burrowing (Mercurio and Andreone 2006). 
","
Scaphiophryne gottlebei was until recently actively collected for the pet-trade. Thousands of individuals are captured each year, especially during the breeding season. For this it is potentially threatened. According to recent evaluations it has been included in the IUCN category CR, â€œcritically endangeredâ€. Although the number collected is high, the species appears potentially widely distributed in the Isalo Massif, and its life history stresses the good capacity of recovery. The species is potentially able to breed in captivity: the high number of deposited eggs and the rapidity of larval development are positive factors for the realisation of captive stocks, which would therefore limit the capture from the wild environment. Thus although this species is included in CITES II, we have reasons to believe that S. gottlebei is not threatened by the capture activity. The pet-trade should be controlled, however, and for this an export quota number is urgently needed.

On the other hand, it is probable that some small (sub)populations are threatened by mining activity, which occurs in the Ilaka area. As is the case for many other critically endangered species, more data are badly needed to complete a comprehensive conservation scenario. The inclusion in CITES II provides some protection.    
","
Only pertinent to the interest for pet-trade and market demand.

The species is tetraploid.

This species has the unusual situation where males (50mm) are larger than females (40mm) and the males have noticeably much broader heads than the females.  They are an olive green to almost black above and often have some dark flecking, splotching and/or variegations on the back.  There are also sometimes warts on this skin and some females from upland areas of northern NSW have a mid-dorsal stripe.  Males have a black belly with white spots whereas females have a belly with black and white marbled.  The rest of the underside is dark with some white spotting.  Both sexes have orange to red patches in the groin, the thighs and even down to the feet.  Both males and females have two pseudo-dentary teeth sticking up from the tip of the lower jaw and these tusks give the species its common name.  The tusks are somewhat larger in the males and are thought to be used mainly in territorial encounters when looking for or holding on to calling sites.  Males in captivity have been observed to â€œlock jawsâ€ by grabbing each otherâ€™s mouths.

This frog is reasonably distinguishable from all other Australian frogs by the combination of the orange or red patches in the groin and on the thigh and the presence of the black and white belly.  Pseudophryne toadlets have the black and white belly, but not the patches.  Uperoleia toadlets have the groin and thigh patches, but not the black and white belly.

","
Range and Population 
Disjunct population in the Clarke Range (mid-eastern Queensland) then from Shoalwater Bay (mid-eastern Queensland) south along the coast to Moss Vale (mid-eastern New South Wales) and inland to Blackdown Tableland and Carnarvon Gorge. The extent of occurrence of the species is approximately 480700 km2. This frog remains reasonably common throughout its entire range and is still so today in the lowland areas.  In the mid to late 1970s however, it disappeared from the New England Tablelands for reasons that are still not clear.  It is presumed that land clearing, habitat alteration, loss of water quality, spread of exotic fish species (eg, plague minnow) and disease and all had some part to play in this decline.  The only populations recorded on the Tablelands in recent years have been seen in the Nowendoc area, at the very southern end of the Tablelands.  For this reason, the New England Tablelands population of this frog has recently been listed as an Endangered Population under the Threatened Species Conservation Act.

Habitat
Tusked frogs are found through a broad range of habitats covering open grasslands, large swamps, low woodlands, dry and wet sclerophyl forests and rainforest and appear none too concerned about whether the site is natural or artificial or whether it is pristine or highly disturbed.  They rarely occur above 400m asl and will breed in quite a broad range of sites for an Australian frog, being found wherever there is relatively still water.  They have been observed calling (rarely) in temporary pools on the sides of roads, in larger flooded depressions, in permanent fire dams and ponds and on the banks of small to quite large streams.  In the faster flowing streams the tadpoles probably stick to specific microhabitats to avoid being washed around too much.
 




","
The tusked frog has a calling season that usually extends through the warmer months although, the majority of calling occurs between September and December.  Males usually call from within the water hiding under rocks or accumulated debris, within or under emergent/overhanging vegetation or from within tunnels/burrows in the banks of the water body.  They are adaptable too with one male known to regularly call from under the wheel hub of an old car.  The call is a soft â€œbâ€™lookâ€ repeated regularly (described in Martin Robinsonâ€™s field guide as a â€œtokâ€ or â€œchuckâ€).  An important point to note about the call is that it is distinctly, albeit subtly, in two parts (b followed by look).  It is this that distinguishes the call of the tusked frog from the quite similar â€œtokâ€ call of the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii). 

The eggs are unpigmented and laid into a foam nest that is concealed underneath vegetation and/or debris.  An adult male has been observed dragging eggs on to the egg mass to conceal it, probably a first for this type of parental care in Australian frogs.  The eggs hatch after several days and the tadpoles take an average of 2-3 months to reach metamorphosis.  The tadpoles are an unremarkable brown colour and grow up to around 30mm in size.  Development is usually complete within 71 days.


","

","
Dead frogs that have suffered chytrid fungus have been found in south-eastern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales.  The major threat to the species, however, is loss and degradation of habitat through agricultural and urban development.

Conservation Measures
In protected areas the species is safe from habitat loss. Research into the spread of chytrid fungus and education on methods of minimising and preventing its spread.

Typically found in marshy country, particularly in the vicinity of grass-lined streams and ponds or 
flooded paddocks. By day hides under logs, stones and debris near the water's edge.  In 
Western Australia it is confined to roadside situations at the base of dense grasses.
Breeding can occur at anytime during the year but most commonly between August and March. 
Males call from the edge of shallow water, partly concealed by vegetation. The species lays 
floating foam nests of 90 to 1350 eggs in water attached to emergent vegetation.  Tadpoles take 
3 to 5 months to develop, but may be shorter in the warmer climate of Western Australia. Some

Myobatrachus gouldii is a small frog and has a distinct globular body form with a head much smaller than its body and reduced eyes.  Perhaps most notable is its short muscular arms which they use for burrowing forward through moist, sandy soils. It has a reduced 4th finger (Barker et al 1995; Vertucci et al 2017). 

Its overall coloration varies from light pink to dark brown with its limbs and ventral side often lighter colored.
","
Found only in the southwest and arid (central) zones of Western Australia. The extent of occurrence of the species is approximately 111800 km2. They are associated with open woodland and dense scrub in sand hills or where soil is leached grey sand.



","
Often found in association with termite nests as it feeds on termites. Usually found in soft sandy soils buried under logs and rocks. They avoid hard substrates and drainage channels. Emerges after rain. They are fossorial and do not hop.

Breeds after heavy rain that triggers emergence. Males call from the soil surface or with only their heads uncovered from September-February (spring to late summer). Vertucci et al (2017) described the calls of Myobatrachus gouldii and compared with other myobatrachids Arenophryne rotunda and Metacrinia nichollsi, finding the calls highly conservative. Both the male and female burrow together although amplexus has not been witnessed; Anstis et al (2007) reports they remain together until autumn eggs are laid. Eggs are very large and up to 40 are laid about 80-115 cm or up to 1 â€“ 1.2 m underground (Anstis et al 2007; Vertucci et al 2017). 

Development is terrestrial and occurs within the egg capsule (Roberts 1981).

This species was featured in news of the week 31 October 2022:
Frogs have a unique spine that is shorter than most other tetrapods to provide axial rigidity for efficient jumping. Adler et al. (2022) measured the shape of the presacral vertebrae among more than 200 frog species to examine how the individual bones within the spine have evolved over the more than 200 million years of frog evolution. They discovered high evolutionary rates in the cervical vertebrae and in the more caudal trunk vertebrae but little evidence for selection pressures related to adult or larval ecology. However, they found body size was highly associated with vertebrae shape and microhabitat (especially burrowing) affected those allometric relationships. Their results differ from patterns of vertebrae evolution in other clades, such as mammals, and serve as a jumping-off point for studies of anuran vertebrae evolution and development.

","
Odontophrynus americanus is a robust-bodied leptodactylid frog with an average snout-vent length of 42.2 mm for males and 44.6 mm for females. The head, when viewed from above, is rounded and is wider than it is long. The snout is blunt and truncate. The eye is circular and the pupil is horizontal. The upper eyelids have warts that are approximately the same size. The tympanum is not visible. The dorsum is covered in warts and ridges. The belly is granular. It has a short glandular inner tarsal fold and a single glandular ridge on the posterior forearm. The limbs are short at about half the length of the hind limbs. Their slender fingers are smooth on top and the second and fourth fingers are almost equal in length with the third finger being the longest. The fingers have claw shaped terminal phalanges. Webbing is present on hind limbs. Their lengths of their toes are as follows: 4 > 3 > 5 > 2 > 1. No disks are present. They have an enlarged inner metatarsal tubercle used for burrowing. They have one median vocal pouch and paired lateral vocal slits. No nuptial pads, enlarged temporal glands, enlarged parotoid glands, or tibial glands were present (Savage and Cei 1965).

The tadpoleâ€™s body shape is globose. The fins meet with the body about 1/3 length from the head. The eyes and nostrils are located dorsally. The tadpoles have sinistral spiracles with median vents. They have complex mouthparts with weakly serrated beaks. Labial papillae are present laterally and along the lower labium, while papillae are absent on the median upper labium (Savage and Cei 1965). The tadpoles have 2/3 denticle rows with the first lower row and second upper row in two parts (Starrett 1960).

Odontophrynus americanus can be differentiated from similar species because the adults have similarly-sized warts on the upper eyelids and back. They have an absence of enlarged paratoid, postorbital, temporal, and tibial glands as well as an absence of the tensor fasciae latae muscle. Their labial papillae are not pigmented heavily with black coloration (Savage and Cei 1965). Additionally, unlike most frogs, Odontophrynus americanus is tetraploidy with a total of 44 chromosomes (Bogart 1967).  The tetraploid O. americanus, is morphologically cryptic with the diploid O. cordobae. The two can be differentiated, statistically, by their similar release call with O. americanus having a single pulsed release call similar to their advertisement call (Grenat and Martino 2013). They can also be differentiated based on range (Martino and Sinsch 2002). Odontophrynus americanus can also be differentiated from the diploid O. juquinha by O. americanus being tetraploid, having chromosomal differences, having a lower pulse rate in their advertisement call, and having larger tadpoles (Rocha et al. 2017). 

Adults have dark blotches on lighter coloration. The upper surfaces of their head, body, and limbs are brown with dark brown blotches outlined in black, sometimes with reddish coloration. On the side of their heads and upper lips, they have large rectangular light and dark blotches. Their undersides are an off-white color with slight brown mottling. Adult males have throats that are dark gray (Savage and Cei 1965). Sexual dimorphism is absent (Quiroga et al. 2015). 

Tadpoles are dorsally and laterally brown, while they are ventrally transparent. Their tail fins and musculature are pigmented along with the presence of light spots. There is a light line that runs along the underside of the fin (Savage and Cei 1965).

Savage and Cei (1965) noted differences between populations from Bolivia and Choya, Provincia de Santiago del Estero, Argentina, with the former having smaller males and the latter having atypical coloration. 
","
Odontophrynus americanus is found in the semi-arid regions in subtropical Argentina, the humid forests of Bolivia, coastal central and southeastern Brazil, southern Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is common to the Campo, Chaco, and Pampa dry forest formations (Savage and Cei 1965). It occurs in terrestrial and freshwater systems in open grasslands and savannahs. In addition to natural areas, O. americanus can also reside near agricultural lands and urbanized areas (Cabagna et al. 2006). During or shortly after heavy rainfalls, it can be found at flooded areas or temporary ponds (Aquino et al. 2010). It occurs in elevations ranging from sea level to 900 meters (Savage and Cei 1965).
","
Odontophrynus americanus is nocturnal. This species is abundant in the wild. They are semi-aquatic and found in semi-arid regions and humid forests (Savage and Cei 1965). Odontophrynus americanus is a generalist feeder.

The species is an explosive breeder that mate in freshwater permanent, semi permanent, and temporary ponds after heavy rains. Matured females occur in every month except in June. During breeding, males call at night in or at the edge of the water to attract females (Valdez and Maneyro 2016). 

Male O. americanus call frequency is 1025 â€“ 1075 Hz and the pulse rate is 524 â€“ 558ms (Rosset and Baldo 2014). The duration of the call is 170 â€“ 381 ms (Grenat and Martino 2013).  

Male frogs are territorial and the males undergo physical combat to fight each other for a mate (Valdez and Maneyro 2016). The males use the axillary amplexus position when mating. This species does not have aposematic body coloration, but instead have cryptic coloration (Grenat 2012).

After mating, females release their eggs on the muddy bottom of their mating sites (Grenat 2012). There have not been enough studies done to determine the number of eggs in their clutch, however, clutch size is correlated to the size of the mature females (Valdez and Maneyro 2016). A closely related species, Odontophrynus cordobae, lays eggs in a range between 1180 to 7080 eggs (Grenat 2012). It takes seven to nine months for O. americanus tadpoles to develop (Gallardo 1963). A clutch completes its development in 12 to 15 days. Development and metamorphosis are influenced by temperature (Martino 1999). There is no parental care after mature females deposit their eggs. Their larvae thrive in the habitat they were hatched in (Echeverria et al. 2007). 

","
The tadpoles are benthic feeders and eat plant debris and algae (Echeverria et al. 2007).  They are preyed on by various animals including invasive species such as Rana catesbeiana (Leivas 2013). Their defenses mechanisms are to burrow into the ground with their hind legs and to change their posture to a flat body with stretched legs (Maffei and Ubaid 2016). 
","
Odontophrynus americanus has stable populations and there are no major threats against the species. Despite their stable populations, there may be some arising threats due to anthropogenic activity. Since this species occur in agricultural areas, insecticides such as Fenitrothion, could be a threat to this species. The species seem to recover quickly, but the insecticide, even in low doses, still has effects in aquatic environments (Lajmanovich et al. 2009). If their food sources are poisoned, Odontophrynus americanus could be threatened by secondary poisoning. Cypermethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, could also pose a threat to this species because it is lethal to tadpoles even in low concentrations and it affects adults by disrupting their genetic makeup through breaking, deleting, or rearranging their chromosomes (Cabagna et al. 2006).

Fortunately, this species is abundant throughout its regions; therefore, they are of least concern, and no conservation work has been done (Aquino et al. 2010).

Odontophrynus americanus is derived from the prefix â€œodonto-â€ meaning â€œteethâ€ and â€œamericanusâ€ meaning â€œAmerican.â€ 

This species was originally known as Pyxicephalus americanus (Savage and Cei 1965). In the context of its previous name, â€œpyxisâ€ means â€œround or box,â€ â€œcephalusâ€ means â€œhead."" The species has also been known as Tomopterna americanus by Fitzinger in 1843 and as Ceratophrys americana by Boulenger in 1882 (Savage and Cei 1965).

In 2022, Rosset et al. synonymized O. occidentalis with O. americanus on the basis of surprising similarities of the position, number, size, and shape of the glandular warts and geographic range. (The range of O. americanus overlapped with O. occidentalis in the Sierra de Cordoba of Argentina and is adjacent to the range of O. cultripes in Estado do Sao Paulo, Brazil (Savage and Cei 1965).) They further provide taxonomic details and basis for Odontophrynus americanus and O. asper (Rosset et al 2022).

Unlike most frogs, Odontophrynus americanus are tetraploids with a total of 44 chromosomes (Bogart 1967).

 P. boiei is distributed along eastern Brazil, associated with the Atlantic Rainforest and transition areas with Cerrado, from south of the state of EspÃ­rito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, ParanÃ¡ to south of Santa Catarina, up to 1,200 m a.s.l (Prado & Pombal, 2008). The species is more commonly found in the leaf litter inside woodlands (Haddad & Sazima, 1992; Zina et al., 2007; Serafim et al., 2008), near small, narrow permanent slow-flowing streams (Conte and Machado, 2005).
","
Males of this species call at night from the ground (Conte and Machado 2005) or near small slow-flowing forest streams or swamps (Bertoluci and Rodrigues 2002; Conte and Rossa-Feres 2006). Sometimes it can be found calling in secondary growth forests (Heyer et al. 1990; Canelas and Bertoluci 2007). The calling season ranges from September to January, with a peak of abundance of calling males at the end of the rainy season (Bertoluci 1998). Most of the calling activity takes place in the beginning of the night (Pombal 1997). The advertisement call lacks harmonic structure; the call is given sporadically and span over 0.7-0.8 s (Heyer et al. 1990). The call can be heard on Haddad et al. (2005). 

The eggs can be laid in swamps (reproductive mode 1 of Haddad & Prado, 2005) or in streams (mode 2), and tadpoles are benthic (Izecksohn et al. 1979). Newly metamorphosed specimens can be found in February (Prado & Pombal 2008). 

P. boiei seems to be very common within its range, though not found very densely in the leaf litter (Giaretta et al. 1999; Rocha et al. 2007). 

The diet is composed basically of crickets, beetles, Blattodea, other leaf litter frogs, and spiders (Giaretta et al. 1998; Ribeiro et al. 2005). Giaretta et al. (1998) report an ontogenetic diet variation for the species. 


","
The tadpole was described by Izecksohn et al. (1979). At stage 34 the body is elliptical and depressed. Eyes dorsolateral. Oral apparatus ventral, surrounded by a single row of marginal papillae; submarginal papillae present on both sides of oral disc. LTRF 2(2)/3(1). Nares elliptical. Spiracle tube sinistral, directed dorsoposteriorally. The body is light brown, with some dark blotches. The venter is scattered with golden blotches. The dorsal portion of the caudal musculature is scattered with dark brown blotches. 
","
Many protected areas cover its range, including Parque Estadual Intervales, EstaÃ§Ã£o BiolÃ³gica de BoracÃ©ia, Serra do Japi, Reserva BiolÃ³gica Augusto Ruschi, RPPN Serra do CaraÃ§a, Parque Nacional da Tijuca, Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina, PETAR, Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, Parque Nacional da Serra do Ã“rgÃ£os, Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar. It is a common species within its range.
","
It is used internationally as a pet. 
","
The epithet of this species was given in honor of Mr. Boie, a traveler who first collected the specimens used in the description of the species. 

The northern population of Proceratophrys boiei, from northern EspÃ­rito Santo to CearÃ¡, was given the name P. renalis; this species was formerly under the synonym of P. boiei (Prado and Pombal 2008).

Tympanic membrane absent. Skin smooth. Sternum ossified. Pupil of the eye is vertical. Webs between the toes well-developed. Inner metatarsal tubercle of hind foot quite large and spade-shaped. No male resonators. Body robust, hind legs short, head large. Inner metatarsal tubercle very large, yellow-brownish in color. Dorsal coloration yellow-grayish, brown-grayish or brown with large dark-brown or dark-olive spots and small reddish points. Belly white-grayish, without pattern or with rare gray points. The frontal surface between the eyes is more or less conspicuous. In contrast to the female, the male possesses a prominent oval gland on the upper surface of the upper arm, and has a smaller body. During the reproductive period the male possesses small tubercles on the palms and forearms.  
 
The Italian subspecies, Pelobates fuscus insubricus, is morphologically quite similar. The only apparent differences are in general a brighter colouration, sometimes with a considerable number of small red or reddish points (especially in females). The head appears slightly larger and prominent. 
 
 
 

","
The species includes two subspecies: P. fuscus insubricus (in northern Italy, apparently extinct in southern Switzerland) and P. fuscus fuscus (inhabiting the main part of the range).  
 
Pelobates fuscus fuscus is distributed in the plains and hills of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, as well as Western Asia, towards the Southern Transuralia and Northern Kazakhstan. The northern margin of the range is limited by the shore of the Baltic Sea, where the distribution is unclear in its eastern part. The margin of the range extends approximately by the line: Pskov and Leningrad provinces (Luga District: ca. 58ÂºN) - south of Vologda Province - Southwestern Kostroma Province - north of Nizhegorodsk Province - Kirov Province (Nolinsk District) - Udmurtia - Perm Province (environs of Perm City: 58Âº00'N, 56Âº13'E) - Sverdlovsk and Tyumen provinces in the Western Siberia, where the easternmost records are Yalutorovsk and Uporovo districts (ca. 57ÂºN, 66Âº30'E). The common spadefoot is absent in the Ural Mountains. The southern margin of the range runs from Germany (Baden-Wurtemberg and Bayern) through Austria, Northeastern Yugoslavia, and Northern Bulgaria to the Black Sea. Eastwards from the Black Sea coast of Precaucasia (Krasnodar Region Novorossisk District, Abrau Peninsula: ca. 44Â° 43'N, 37Â° 30'E), the margin runs to Goryachii Klyuch Town, then to the Sravropol Region - Chechnya and foothill Daghestan (the area between the Kuma and Terek rivers, ca. 46ÂºE). Then the margin runs northwards and northeastwards approximately along the line Chernye Zemli in Kalmykia (ca. 48ÂºN, 44ÂºE) - north of Volgograd Province and the Volga River delta. Then the margin turns eastwards and to the south-south-east in northern Kazakhstan: along the valley of the Malyi Uzen River to Guriev City (47Â° 09'N, 51Â° 56'E). Eastwards, the range margin corresponds to the valleys of the rivers Bolshoi Uzen, Malyi Uzen, Kushum, Ural, Ilek, Emba, Irgiz, Turgai and their tributaries. Then the margin runs northeastwards across the Turgai Plain to Kustanai Province of Kazakhstan (Naurzum Nature Reserve: 51Â° 03'N, 64Â° 02'E) and northwards to Russia, through the Kurgan Province in Tyumen Province.  
 
Pelobates fuscus insubricus is a dubious variety (genetical studies are currently in act), that has also a little know distribution in northern Italy. At the end of the 19th century it was known for about 50 localities, but at the beginning of the seventies (20th century) it was known for only a few localities. For this reason it was considered as a very threatened variety. Active researches carried out by a group of Italian and Swiss herpetologists led to the discoveries of many more localities, and now at the beginning of 21th century P. f. insubricus has been found in many new localities in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Friuli and Venetia. It was also known with historical findings in souther Switzerland (Canton Ticino), but it was not confirmed anymore. 
 
Pelobates fuscus inhabits a wide spectrum of habitats, including different coniferous, deciduous and mixed forests and their edges, groves, steppes, meadows, fields, parks and gardens. However, in forests the common spadefoot prefers open sites. In arid areas, these frogs occur on sands, in wormwood steppes etc. In these places frogs usually live in close proximity to water bodies. In particular, in Northern Kazakhstan P. fuscus is concentrated near pools and on riverbanks consisting of sand with clay and covered with reeds. Individuals occur even on the shores of lakes with salt water. Its fossorial habits have resulted in a strict preference for soft friable soils and an avoidance of rocky and compact soils. Spawning and early development usually occur in permanent, stagnant, more or less deep (to 20-130 cm) water bodies covered with dense grass vegetation: ponds, lakes, flooded quarries, ditches etc. Pleobates fuscus insubricus s mainly known from sandy habitats in northern Italy, although it has been sometimes found in coniferous woods and hilly areas (e.g. Pineta di Classe, Ravenna; Ivrea surroundings, Torino). 
 
 

","
The nominate subspecies is relatively rare at its western limit of distribution (in some areas in France, Belgium and The Netherlands). Throughout Central and continental Eastern Europe it is a common species, except for some marginal areas. In the center of the European part of the former Soviet Union, the abundance of adult toads reaches 45-50 individuals per 100 m2 of pond during the breeding period. Besides its own burrows, the common spadefoot hides in burrows of other animals or even under stones. In suitable habitats, the population density reaches 3-15 specimens per 100 m2, sometimes up to 23 specimens per 150 m2 or even 4-5 specimens per 1 m2. Maximum densities are reported in sandy and ploughed soils.  
 
Little is known about Pelobates fuscus inubricus. Anyhow, the few populational studies confirmed its tendency to behave as an explosive breeder, with reproductive period confined to the early springtime rains (end of March â€“ beginning of April). Only in this period it is virtually observable in epigean activity. Capture-recapture recent studies in a newly discovered breeding pond next to Torino revealed an unexpected abundance (captured about 300 specimens at a site where the species was not known before). It is therefore likely that the presumed rarity is also due to an objective difficulty to come in contact with the spadefoot. 
 
Hibernation occurs from September to the beginning of October (November in the south) to March - April. Common spadefoots hibernate in deep, to 2 m, burrows in soil. These are burrows of other animals, or made by the toads. Burrows are made by digging movements of the hind legs using the large inner metatarsal tubercle. While digging, the animal uses its hind legs one after another in turn, and moves down into the soil posterior body end first. Once in the ground, the spadefoot starts to move loosened soil with its forelegs to bury the entrance.  
 
Reproduction starts soon after the end of hibernation and extends sometimes to June. Males vocalize under water and do not form breeding choruses. Amplexus is pelvic (inguinal). The clutch contains 480-3000 eggs and resembles paired, thick, sausage-like cord up to 1 m in length. Embryogenesis takes 5-11 days, larval development from 56-110 days. Young tadpoles stay usually on bottom. They grow very fast and after 1-2 months attain a size of 35-50 mm and more. At this time, the tadpoles tend to stay on plants within the water column and often appear near the water surface. Metamorphosis occurs in July - September. Newly metamorphosed juveniles bury themselves near the shore and may overwinter there. Otherwise, tadpoles hibernate in unfrozen water and complete metamorphosis the following spring or summer; such tadpoles reach an especially large size. Their metamorphosis occurs usually in the next spring or summer. Recently metamorphosed juveniles in such cases are larger than those which completed their transformation within one season. The long larval period makes the species sensitive to pond quality. Sometimes larval mortality may be high due to the drying of wetlands. Otherwise, larvae may die in frozen water.  
 
Concerning Pelobates fuscus insubricus it is worth stressing that, differently from the nomibnal race, the larval period is considerably shortened. In fact the metamorphosis of tadpoles born in April occurs not later than July. This is and evident ecological adaptation to the harsh conditions and warmer climate (in respect of central Europe) of northern Italy. This is also confirmed by the smaller size reached by tadpoles: 120 mm in insubricus vs. 180 in fuscus. Larval overwintering is not known for Italian populations. 
 
Tadpoles consume detritus and plants, mainly algae, as well as animal matter: Protozoa, Rotatoria, Ostracoda, Copepoda, Cladocera, Mollusca, and sometimes injured tadpoles of their own and other species. Adults eat mainly crawling invertebrates and fast-flying insects are consumed less frequently.  
 
Many invertebrate and vertebrate predators, as well as many parasitic worms attack the Common Spadefoot. Trematodes infest the Common Spadefoot in much higher numbers than in many other terrestrial amphibians. This may be related to the long larval period in as much as tadpoles overwinter in stagnant water bodies.  
 
 
 

","

","
Evidently, P. fuscus was once distributed more widely in the past. For example, subfossil remains have been found in Crimea beyond its recent range, while in Estonia it was recorded much further northwards near Tallin City, at the end of the 19th century. The rarity of this species in these two areas in light of this record indicates that it has probably has undergone a considerable long-term decline there. The causes of this decline are not known but may be related to its very long larval development and high requirements for soil and water quality.  
 
As said before the distribution of P. f. insubricus suggests not only an objective rarity (mainly due to pollution and human disturbance), but also a more secretive life and difficulty of observation. 
 
 

","
Pelobates fuscus seems to be very sensitive to water quality and the structure of the soil. Pollution of wetlands by industry, pesticides, mineral fertilizers, cattle, domestic wastes etc. are harmful to the larvae of this species. Other kinds of human economic activity (destruction of meadows, especially by cattle, urbanization, recreational driving, open wells in sites of the toads' concentration etc.) also have a negative influence. However, some kinds of anthropogenic activity lead to the local distribution of the Common Spadefoot Toad: construction of forest rides, irrigation channels etc. This species lives in settlements and even in large cities if suitable habitats are present, but usually does not attain high abundances in these places. 
 
As concerning Pelobates fuscus insubricus there are histories and/or legends about the fact that before the Second World War the large tadpoles were systematically (?) fished to become part of human nutrition, cooked fried as fishes. It is also sometimes said that these tadpoels were sold at local markets. Personally (F. Andreone) we think that although not excluded that sometimes they could have been eaten, their regular fishing was almost ulikely. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Pelobates fuscus insubricus suffers for a series of problems and constraints. In the Po Plain the human settlements and heavy urban centers (such as Turin and Milan), added to intensive agriculture, make the life of plain organisms very difficult. This is the reason of local extinction and distribution shrinkage of many plaitional species and populations, among which Rana latastei, Emys orbicularis, Zootoca vivipara (plain populations), Vipera berus (plain populations), Rana temporaria (plain populations). Pelobates fuscus insubricus is likely the most heavily affected amphibian. In fact it suffers from (1) habitat distruction (original wetlands wre dried up and ponds are often eliminated), (2) habitat isolation (the residual ponds are surrounded by hostile agricultural habitats), (3) fish introduction (many ponds are colonized by bluegills, catfishes, all heavy predators of early larval stages), (4) introduction of bullfrogs and exotic crayfish. The well known and also relatively abundant populations reproducing in the ricefields of Novara surroundings suffered in the last years a constant lowering due to the evident change of agricultural practice (many ricefields were replaced by Soya fields, the others were made more â€œregularâ€ and less deep). In some cases the residual breeding sites are surrounded by houses and are also filled with materials for building. To contrast this tendency and possible population reduction the Italian subspecies has been declared â€œasterisked taxonâ€ in the Habitat Directive. Furthermore it has been object of a conservation campaign of WWF Italia. This campaign had â€“ among its concrete programs â€“ the attempts of captive breeding for reintroduction. Anyhow, despite the good results in documenting the breeding behavior, little results were until now obtained in the sense of population reintroduction and reinforcement.

Pelodytes caucasicus lives in the area of mountain forests of the Caucasian Isthmus. In Russia, it lives in the mountainous parts of Krasnodar Region and probably North Ossetia. The easternmost records in the North Caucasus (in Southern Chechnya) need verification. In Georgia, this species lives primarily in the western part and in South Ossetia. The northern limit of the range extends in Russia from Shapsugsky and Erivansky settlements in the vicinity of Novorossiisk City (ca. 44Âº46'N, 38ÂºE) by the northern slope of the Main Caucasian Ridge southeastwards to the headwaters of the Urup River (ca.43Âº40'N, 41ÂºE). The limit extends southwards to the southern slope of the Main Caucasian Ridge and along this eastwards in a line from Gagra Town to the Inguri River to Shovi Settlement to Barisakho Settlement to Zakataly Town (ca. 41Âº41'N, 46Âº34'E). The southern range margin extends from the Black Sea shore of Turkey (Rize Vilayet) and Georgia through the southern slope of Adjaro-Imeretian Ridge, northeastward to Telavi Town to Azerbaijan (Zakataly Nature Reserve: 41Âº47'N, 46Âº36'E) and possibly Belokany District. The range extends along the Main Caucasian Ridge as a narrow band 10-30 km in width and 750 km in length.

Pelodytes caucasicuslives in broad-leaved, mixed coniferous-deciduous and, rarely, coniferous mountain forests and the subalpine belt. It occurs on the shores and banks of ponds and streams with clear and cold semi-flowing and flowing water, sometimes 200-300 m away from water. The Caucasian Parsley Frog is a clearly psychrophilous amphibian, preferring shaded and cool conditions.





","
Population density of this species is locally high, sometimes 5-10 adult individuals per 25-100 m2 of pond surface. However, its distribution is quite patchy, and probably it is a rare species. In general, the frog is more numerous in the North Caucasus than in Transcaucasia.

Hibernation occurs from September - November to March. Reproduction occurs between May and December, but usually between May and September, with the peak usually in June - July. Spawning occurs in shaded sites. Each female reproduces once during the season. This species is not an ""explosive breeder"", and the spawning season may be long even in the same water body. The males usually spend the day near the water body (under tree roots, in holes on the shore etc.) and at night return to breeding pools. Males arrive before females and vocalize in the evening and the first half of the night. The clutch contains 80-750 eggs which are deposited in a few small portions in the form of mucous sacs. The tadpoles may undergo metamorphosis 2-3 months later, but frequently the larvae overwinter and complete their metamorphosis during the following year, in April - July (usually May - June). Sometimes the tadpoles hibernate for the second time. Sexual maturity is attained at 2-3 years old or later. Maximum longevity in this species is estimated as 9 years.

","
Not studied.




","
Mortality on roads, pollution of wetlands by pesticides, mineral fertilizers and cattle, as well as collecting by people are known as negative anthropogenic factors. However, there are no clear data on population declines under the influence of anthropogenic activity. Nevertheless, the species has a low potential for synanthropization: its populations are not known even in settlements.

A medium-sized Phrynobatrachus with a pointed, but rounded snout and a warty skin. Males reach 25â€“30 mm, females 26â€“31 mm (SVL). The index head width/SVL is 0.24â€“0.29. Four warts forming two longitudinal groups of two are found at shoulder level, converging slightly towards the head. A feebly developed supratympanal fold is present. The tympanum is barely visible. Males have a single subgular vocal sac. Inactive it forms numerous folds on the throat, running either irregularly or parallel to the jaw. This feature is probably visible only during the breeding season. Feet with a small inner metatarsal tubercle. An outer metatarsal tubercle at the base of the fifth toe. Tarsal tubercle present. Webbing formula: 1 (0); 2 i/e (1â€“0) or (1â€“0.5); 3 i/e (1); 4 i/e (2); 5 (0.5) or (1). Tips of toes and fingers not enlarged. Hands not webbed; those of males bear a thenar tubercle which is enlarged at least during the breeding season.
Voucher specimens: SMNS 8960 1â€“9; SMF 78634, 78636.
The very uniform color of the dorsum is light to dark brown. Only the areas around the warts, the latter and the transversal bands on the extremities may be somewhat darker. No lateral lines. At night, some breeding males occasionally show green dorsal patches and interorbital lines. The longitudinal line on the posterior parts of the thighs is either feebly defined or absent. The vocal sac of the male is black with numerous prominent white spots. The color of female throats varies from white to white with black spots or even black. The edge of the lower jaw is spotted black. A narrow black line occasionally runs from the feebly spotted flanks to the center of the pectoral region. The rest of the venter is white.
Lambiris (1989) and Passmore & Carruthers (1995) show animals with broad vertebral bands. Lamotte & Xavier (1966a) report on vaguely marbled mottled posterior parts of the thighs (sometimes irregular bordered longitudinal lines), a light interorbital line and large black dorsal blotches. In alcohol, the dorsum is uniform drab brown, and just the patches on the extremities are feebly discernible. The ventral color does not change.
The voice is an amplitude modulated, very loud ""craa"" resembles the call of a toad. A call sequence consists of 4â€“230 calls and lasts about 4.6â€“147 sec. 1â€“2 calls per second are uttered. Frequency ranges from 1.2â€“2.3 kHz. SchiÃ¸tz (1963) describes the call as a buzzing hum which is uttered in the daytime. This observation however, rather applies to P. francisci and the sonagram he published shows a call which resembles that of P. francisci. It lasts 0.3 sec, and the dominant frequency is 1.5 kHz (SchiÃ¸tz 1964c). Van den Elzen & Kreulen (1979) give a call duration of 0.62 sec. The pauses between these calls last 0.69 sec. The dominant frequency ranges from 1.1â€“1.5 kHz. The sonic pressure has been measured by Passmore (1981). At a distance of 50 cm, it amounts to 104 dB. DuPreez (1996) describes the call as a vibrant â€˜ghrr-uu-ghrr-uuâ€™.

A female laid 1652 eggs forming a single floating film. They were brown-white and measured 0.8â€“1.0 mm (egg diameter incl. jelly: 1.8â€“2.0 mm). The tadpoles hatched within half a day. According to Passmore & Carruthers (1995), the clutch has a diameter of 8 cm. Wager (1986) describes an egg film of 10 cm diameter, consisting of 500â€“800 eggs. The eggs measure 1 mm (2 mm incl. jelly). The tadpoles hatch 3â€“4 days later. Lambiris (1989) reports on a compact mass of 400 eggs laid in the midst of vegetation at the surface of the water. He gives the egg diameter with 1 mm (1.8 mm incl. jelly). They are light brown, with a somewhat lighter ventral side. His tadpoles hatched two days later. According to Balinsky (1969), each egg film consists of several hundred eggs. It floats at the surface, or below, the latter if the eggs stick to vegetation, and if the level of the water rises after spawning. Rose (1959) reports on 200â€“400 reddish-brown eggs per clutch. The eggs float on the surface. According to DuPreez (1996) a clutch comprises approx. 500 eggs. Fischer & Hinkel (1992) report on small clumps of eggs attached to aquatic plants, immediately beneath the surface.
The keratodont formula of tadpoles from ComoÃ© National Park is 1 // 1+1 / 1. The oral disc is surrounded by one lateral, and two caudal rows of papillae. The caudal one consists of very long, filiform papillae. The horny teeth are short, compact and have six tips. The larvae are nearly indistinguishable from Phrynobatrachus latifrons tadpoles.
According to Lambiris (1988), tadpoles reach up to 35 mm (TL). The fin is feebly spotted, and the oral disc is surrounded lateral and caudal by papillae rows of equal length. Wager (1986) figures a larva whose body is more elongate than that of typical Phrynobatrachus tadpoles. The lateral papilla row is simple before the corners of the mouth, and double caudad of this area. All papillae are of equal length. The keratodont formula of the tadpoles is 1 / 1+1 // 2. They reach a TL of 35 mm (BL: 12 mm) and metamorphose at the age of four to five weeks (Wager 1986, DuPreez 1996). The tadpole described by Lambiris (1989), whose back, tail base and caudal bear black spots, grows as fast as the former and reaches the same length, but its keratodont formula is 1 / 2+2 // 1+1 / 2. According to Balinsky (1969), tadpoles metamorphose at the age of 27â€“40 days. Their development is normal at water temperatures of 21.5 to 34 Â°C but stagnates at lower temperatures, and the tadpoles will die when the above-mentioned level is surpassed. SVL after metamorphosis is 12.5 mm (Patterson & McLachlan 1989).

At ComoÃ© National Park, this species is found both in larger savanna ponds harboring an abundant vegetation and in car tracks on the edges of forests which lack any trace of vegetation. This species apparently avoids closed rainforests (Noble 1924, GuibÃ© & Lamotte 1963). Almost any type of habitat is quoted in the literature (BÃ¶hme 1994d); however, arid savannas with or without scattered trees are preferred (Mertens 1940, Perret & Mertens 1957b, SchiÃ¸tz 1964c, 1967, Broadley 1971, Lambiris 1988, Patterson & McLachlan 1989). Laurent (1979a) quotes both lowland and montane savannas. According to Lambiris (1988b) in Natal P. natalensis inhabits regions of up to 1500 m a.s.l. In South Africa, swamps and smaller temporary water bodies are colonized (Balinsky 1969, Passmore & Carruthers 1995). Smaller water bodies are also quoted by Loveridge (1933) and Fischer & Hinkel (1992). Poynton & Broadley (1985b) and Lambiris (1988) give contrary data. These authors report on permanent or semi-permanent waters. However, in the same publication they underline that these frogs prefer shallow water. Mertens (1955b) reports on animals found in a bat cave.

Both sexes migrate to the ponds after rainfall. Males call  at night from the grass on the edge of the water, or on bare ground. During the dry season, these frogs possibly live on the edges of puddles near the Kongo, a tributary of the ComoÃ©. In March I once heard the call of this species in the day time at this site but did not succeed in locating the frogs. In the late rainy season P. natalensis starts calling regularly at dusk and continues through the night. Most choruses established along water filled car tracks without any vegetation. Here males call from the bare ground or while sitting in shallow water. Population densities were always much lower than in P. latifrons and P. francisci. P. natalensis was never observed at the respective sites during the day. According Lamotte & Xavier (1966a), just a few individuals of this nocturnal species are usually captured. According to Passmore & Carruthers (1995), P. natalensis begins to call only at 1.00 h a.m. and is heard till dawn. This observation is confirmed by Bowker & Bowker (1979), at least as far as the majority of the frogs is concerned. At the Kenyan pond observed by the latter authors, the frogs thus apparently avoided  P. acridoides which called in the early evening hours. At Mporokoso, Zambia, P. natalensis began calling around 1 p.m. after heavy rain (Pickersgill pers. comm.). Perhaps calling is only restricted to certain hours were they live in sympatry with other Phrynobatrachus species. In Namibia P. natalensis calls day and night in wet weather (Channing & Griffin 1993).
According to Lambiris (1988), exposed locations on the edges of the pools or plants growing in shallow water are chosen as calling sites. The frogs are usually met near open water. They are diurnal but will also call at night in periods of rainfall (Lambiris 1988b, 1989). Van den Elzen & Kreulen (1979) quote calling sites on plants, in shallow water zones and even beneath the surface. Probably they refer to a distinct cryptic species which lives in the Tanzanian upland (Pickersgill pers. comm.). In Nigeria, Walker (1968) found this species during the dry season. The frogs were usually encountered on riverbanks, i.e. far away from their savanna ponds. As he mentions neither P. francisci nor P. latifrons or P. accraensis, his statements possibly refer to one of the latter species.
Inger & Marx (1961) found that this species mainly preys on terrestrial organisms. In particular, they quote beetles, termites, bugs, spiders, flies, cockroaches, orthopterans and butterflies. Termites are reported to form the bulk of the diet during the rainy season. Noble (1924) and Loveridge (1936) likewise cite termites and ants as prey.
At ComoÃ© National Park, this species is found both in larger savanna ponds harboring an abundant vegetation and in car tracks on the edges of forests which lack any trace of vegetation. This species apparently avoids closed rainforests (Noble 1924, GuibÃ© & Lamotte 1963). Almost any type of habitat is quoted in the literature (BÃ¶hme 1994d); however, arid savannas with or without scattered trees are preferred (Mertens 1940, Perret & Mertens 1957b, SchiÃ¸tz 1964c, 1967, Broadley 1971, Lambiris 1988, Patterson & McLachlan 1989). Laurent (1979a) quotes both lowland and montane savannas. According to Lambiris (1988b) in Natal P. natalensis inhabits regions of up to 1500 m a.s.l.

Color is brown to grey having small spots. Tongueless, tapered heads. Eyes lidless, circular, and flat. Long-legged, claws on rear feet. Looks simliar to H. curtipes but H. curtipes has wartier skin. Females reach a larger size than males (up to 35 mm), have a longer tail and also have a more stout abdominal region. The posteriorlateral portion on the head of a male has a  swollen appearance due to a large orbiculate tympanum (2.5 mm). Orbiculate tympanus in males is twice as large as in females. Males also have a post axillary subdermal gland  which appears as a whitish spot on the surface of the skin. The post-axillary subdermal gland is located on the back of the front leg. The gland enlarges during periods of sexual activity. Females lay eggs with a diamter of about 1.3 mm (Rabb 1963). 
 
 
Tadpoles have spinose tubercules on the sides of thigh. Silvery iridocytes on a gray dorsum and a weakly pigmented tail. The iridocytes may be golden or silver. The tail has a longitudinal arrangement of dark coloration where melanophores surround the aorta, caudal vein, and the top and bottom of the caudal musculature.  Golden iridocytes are also found on the top of the caudal muscles.  The tail fin is pigmentless (Rabb 1963).

Both adults and tadpoles of this species are predatory suction feeders (Deban 2002). 
 Only males sing. Males can mate throughout the year under laboratory settings. Amplexus occurs at night and can last several hours. After the female has laid all the eggs, she will signal the male by going motionless. As Hymenochirus boettgeri progresses through metamorphosis it losses the ability to regenerate hind-limb structures in the proximal-distal region of the limb. Loss of limb is more easily regenerated if it occurs more distally (Girvan 2002). 
 In development, ossification occurs relatively early in comparison to other pipid species (Olson 2000).

Pipa carvalhoi is a moderate to large-sized species of Pipa, with females reaching 41-68 mm and males measuring 32-57 mm in SVL (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). 
The head is wide and triangular, but not depressed. The snout is broad and pointed, though rounded at the tip, and bears prominent and elliptical nares. Eyes are large and positioned dorsolaterally, with a diameter one-third of the interorbital distance (Trueb and Cannatella 1986; MCZ specimens). This species possesses the most pronounced and numerous teeth of all pipids, present on premaxillae and maxillae, with Trueb and Cannatella (1986) describing the teeth as fanglike.  

The body of P. carvalhoi is long, robust and does not display the same dorsoventral compression present in other pipids (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). It is most similar in form to P. parva and unlike the other five Pipa species. The skin of P. carvalhoi is covered with conical tubercles, or small protuberances. The size and density of the tubercles vary greatly in different regions of the body. Dorsal surfaces display the most extreme tubercles, particularly the posterior portion of the back. Moving from posterior to anterior, the size and density of tubercles diminish. The shoulders have few, poorly defined tubercles and on the snout they are scarce and very small. The ventral portion of the body also has tubercles but they are less prominent and generally uniform in size (they do not intensify at the posterior). The limbs exhibit the same dorsal-ventral pattern as the rest of the body. Although young adults show the same patterns, the intensity of the posterior definition of the tubercles seems to increase with size (MCZ specimens). 
The lateral line organs are numerous. Eight to ten lateral line organs appear on the dorsolateral surface of the snout, between the nostril and the eye. Another six organs spread out from the anterior and anterodorsal margin of the eye. Additionally, there is a double row of organs that parallels the mandible, ending in a proliferation of organs at the angle of the jaw, and still another set extending from the posterodorsal margin of the eye to the mandible. Dorsally, two series of lateral line organs run from the head to about mid-back. Two more series begin just before the forearm. Longitudinally oriented organs run along the flank and end at the groin. A ventrolateral series of vertically oriented organs extends along the flank and then posterodorsally to the vent.  Yet another series is irregularly oriented and extends ventrolaterally from the axillary region along the flank posteromedially to the vent. Ventrally, there are scattered patches of organs in the pectoral region (Trueb and Cannatella 1986).  


The fingertips are specially modified. While all pipids have lobes on the end of each fingertip, the exact arrangement and position varies with the species. Pipa carvalhoi has quadripartite lobes, which are symmetrical and terminally located. This formation is shared with P. aspera, P. arrabali, and P. snethlageae. The toes of P. carvalhoi are also noteworthy as toes I-III have keratinous caps (Caramaschi 1989). While this feature is rare among amphibians generally, all other Pipa except P. pipa and P. snethlageae share this trait. Another feature of the toes used to distinguish among species is the type/presence of an inner metatarsal tubercle. In P. carvalhoi, the tubercle is present but indistinct and poorly developed (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). 

In preserved specimens, the dorsal coloration of the head, back and limbs is dark brown to reddish brown, with occasional dark brown spots. The dorsal surface of the limbs has the lightest ground color and the most distinct marking. Tubercles show no deviation in color. Ventrally, the dark brown fades into a light gray/tan, with some individuals having small spots. While the feet display the same coloration, the webbing between the fingers and toes is transparent (Trueb and Cannatella 1986; Caramaschi 1989; MCZ specimens). 

As is characteristic of all pipids, P. carvalhoi has a labial modification consisting of a small dermal pocket at the angle of the jaw, extending over the mandible. While this labial modification is clearly visible in P. carvalhoi, it is not as extreme as that of P. pipa or P. snethlageae. 
The prearticular region of P. carvalhoiâ€™s mandible is slightly rounded, but not as extreme as the medially directed curvature found in P. pipa or P. snethlageae. In the upper jaw, the pars palatina of the maxilla extends into a palatine process. This process articulates with that of the premaxilla, ultimately modifying and strengthening the palatal shelf of the upper jaw. This is a characteristic shared with five of the seven species of pipids.  The pelvic girdle of pipids is distinctive as a genus, with only slight modification among species. While some, such as P. parva have dorsolaterally oriented iliac crests, those of P. carvalhoi are lateral. As in all pipids, Pipa carvalhoi has a modified arciferal pectoral girdle, and imbricate, opisthocoelous vertebrae. The sacrum and urostyle are fused, and the sacral diapophyses are elongated in the anterior-posterior direction. The ventral-anterior margin of the presacral I (atlas) is straight to slightly concave in P. carvalhoi (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). 

Tadpoles are dark gray-brown dorsally, and transparent ventrally (Sokol 1977).


","
Pipa carvalhoi is found in eastern and northeastern Brazil in the following states: CearÃ¡, ParaÃ­ba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Bahia, EspÃ­rito Santo, Minas Gerais, and (presumably) Rio Grande do Norte and Sergipe. This species is primarily aquatic, but like other Pipa can move across land during heavy rain. Thus, it can be found not only in wetlands, marshes, ponds, and lakes, but also dry and moist savannas. It has been known to inhabit fish-farms where it is controlled as a pest (IUCN 2006). 


","
Pipa carvalhoi exhibits territorial behavior.  Males have been observed defending underwater calling sites; however, their attachment to the same location is unknown. To defend their territory, males use visual displays, and may chase intruders, jump attack, and wrestle. While the behavior of many Pipa is difficult to observe, this territoriality and defense has also been described in P. pipa and P. parva (Duellman and Trueb 1994). 
Pipa carvalhoi's reproductive behavior closely resembles that of other pipids and is nearly identical to that of P. pipa and P. parva, including somersaulting and female dorsal skin brooding. Adult P. carvalhoi are sexually mature at 7 to 9 months. Amplexus is inguinal (the male grabs the female around the waist above the thighs) and occurs while the mating pair is completely submerged in water. The pair, led by the female, begins a series of maneuvers where they swim toward (not reaching) the surface, the female releases eggs mid way, and then during mid-water turnovers, the male fertilizes the eggs and pushes them into the femaleâ€™s dorsum with his vent region. The cycle is repeated until all the eggs are released, fertilized, and implanted (Duellman and Trueb 1994). 
After the eggs have been fertilized, they are implanted in the skin of the femaleâ€™s dorsum. The epidermis and dermis of the femaleâ€™s back during this time undergo significant change:  the egg chambers are highly vascularized and adhere to the single jelly capsule of the egg. The small gills of the developing embryos then engage in gas exchange with the vascularized tissue of the mother. In P. carvalhoi, along with P. parva and P. myersi but unlike other Pipa, the free-living larval stage is still present (Sokol 1977). After 14 to 28 days of dermal brooding, the eggs hatch from the motherâ€™s skin as the tadpoles push their way through the small aperture of the egg chamber. Other pipids such as P. pipa undergo direct development, hatching miniature adult frogs instead of larvae. Because of the increased demands of direct developing young, pipid species with direct development usually have only one annual reproduction cycle. However, species such as P. carvalhoi that produce tadpoles are able to reproduce several times a year.  Captive individuals have been recorded to produce clutches 4 to 8 weeks apart (Duellman and Trueb 1994). 
Tadpoles of P. carvalhoi are between 50 and 60 mm in length at stage 60 (the beginning of cranial metamorphosis). The forelimbs are freed 14 to 21 days prior to cranial metamorphosis, which itself begins at about 60-80 days post-hatching.  The mouth structure is about half the head width and is terminal.  Notably, P. carvalhoi lacks the opercular flap extending across branchial slit II. Thus, internal gills are absent and forelimb development is external and visible, occurring in front of the branchial baskets. The skull and jaws are largely composed of embryonic cartilage and are long, broad and flat (Sokol 1977). 

Both the tail and the lungs are important in hydrostatic stabilization. Tadpoles must fill their lungs before they can swim; with improperly filled lungs, P. carvalhoi larvae will struggle to get to the surface and move (Sokol 1977). 
 To feed, these tadpoles employ hyobranchial pumping to gather particles in the water; they are filter feeders. When food is lacking, the larvae attempt to stir the substrate. Adult feeding begins when the tail is reduced to one-half to one-third its original size (Sokol 1977).

Pipa carvalhoi was originally described by Miranda-Ribeiro (1937a, 1937b). Later that year, Carvalho (1937) described its larval form. Caramaschi (1989) clarified the designation of the lectotype, since Miranda-Ribeiro (1937) did not specify the holotype and paratypes.

Among pipids, P. parva is moderately small, with female snout-vent length (SVL) ranging from 27 to 44 mm and male SVL ranging from 28 to 37 mm. The head is narrow, with large eyes, and the snout is pointed.  As is the case for all other pipids, the tongue is lacking, and the upper lip has a labial pocket at the angle of the jaw.  Teeth are absent on both the pre-maxilla and maxilla (Trueb and Cannatella 1986).  The body is slender and less depressed relative to other Pipa (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). The skin is covered with small protuberances, or tubercles, of varying size, density, and definition. On the head, tubercles tend to be smaller but uniform in size and distribution, while on the back they are dense and large. Upper surfaces of the limbs also have large tubercles, though not as numerous. Ventral tubercles are generally less prominent and less dense (MCZ specimens; Trueb and Cannatella 1986). On the feet, recurved spinose tubercles are present on the inner first toe and outer fifth toe, as well as on the tarsus, and smaller recurved spinose tubercles are present on the plantar surface (Trueb and Cannatella 1986).

The fingertips of Pipa generally and P. parva specifically are quite distinctive. Pipids have evolved uniquely modified lobes on the end of each fingertip, with the exact form and location of these lobes varying by species. Pipa parva displays four distinct lobes asymmetrically distributed on the fingertip. One pair of lobes is terminally located while the other is slightly proximal and on the palmar surface (MCZ specimens), distinguishing this species from all other pipids (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). In addition to unique fingertips, P. parva (and all other pipids except P. pipa and P. snethlageae) have keratinous tips on toes I-III, a relatively rare feature among amphibians (Duellman and Trueb 1994). On the feet of five of the seven species of Pipa, there is an inner metatarsal tubercle, which ranges from well developed (as in P. pipa) to less developed (as in P. aspera). However, the inner metatarsal tubercles are absent altogether in P. parva and P. myersi (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). 

Pipa parva has several series of lateral line organs.  One series extends from the snout to the anterior margin of each eye, with an additional organ or two associated with the dorsal or ventral margins of the eye. Another series, with vertically oriented organs, commences at each side of the head at the angle of the jaw, and runs posteriorly from the jaw over the forearm and along the ventral side of the flank. A paired, longitudinal series runs from the temporal region of the head down the dorsum. Yet another longitudinal series extends from each forearm along the dorsal side of the flank (Trueb and Cannatella 1986).  

The skull is longer than it is wide, and relatively elongate compared to other pipid species, though still possessing the characteristic wedge shape. Unlike most species of Pipa, P. parva does not possess a palatine process of the maxilla or pre-maxilla.  In addition, the pre-articular mandibular bones are relatively straight (compared to those of P. snethlageae and P. pipa, which have a medial curve), giving P. parva its ventrally narrow snout. The presacral vertebral column of Pipa parva also shows some differences from other pipids. In all Pipa, vertebrae are imbricate and opisthocoelous. The sacrum and urostyle are fused, and the sacral diapophyses are hugely elongated in the anterior-posterior direction. However, the ventral anterior margin of the presacral I (Atlas) has convex articulation in P. parva (as in P. myersi, and P. snethlageae), while other pipids have straight or somewhat concave articulation (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). The pelvic girdle of Pipa is distinctive as a genus, with only slight modification among species: P. parva has dorsolaterally oriented ilial crests (as is the case for P. pipa and P. snethlageae), rather than the completely depressed or lateral iliac crests found in other species of Pipa.  As in all Pipa, Pipa parva has a modified arciferal pectoral girdle (Trueb and Cannatella 1986). 

In preserved specimens, these frogs have a dorsally uniform dark brown coloration on the head, back, limbs and associated tubercles. Ventrally, the dark brown fades into a light gray/tan, and may be unspotted or have sparse indistinct spots on the pectoral region (MCZ specimens, Trueb and Cannatella 1986). Some specimens have been reported as brown with tan tubercles and scattered dark brown spots (Trueb and Cannatella 1986), or blackish gray dorsally with obscure darker spots, and grayish white ventrally, with some spotting on the flanks and throat (Ruthven and Gaige 1923). While the feet have the same coloration, the webbing between the fingers and toes is completely transparent (MCZ specimens; Trueb and Cannatella 1986). 



 Tadpoles of P. parva reach about 40 mm in length. The mouth structure is about half the head width and is terminal, slightly toward the ventral side of the head. Notably, P. parva lacks the opercular flap extending across branchial slit II. Thus, internal gills are absent and forelimb development is external and visible. The skull and jaws are largely composed of embryonic cartilage and are long, broad and flat. Tadpoles are dark gray-brown dorsally, with transparent ventral surfaces (Sokol 1977). 


","
Pipa parva occurs in the north of Venezuela and in a small part of northeastern Colombia, at elevations up to 300 m above sea level. The distribution surrounds the Lake Maracaibo Basin. Additionally, this species has been introduced into the Lake Valencia Basin in northern Venezuela. Due to its hardiness, and the fact that P. parva's expansion into central Venezuela has already begun, it is feared that this introduction into the Lake Valencia Basin will lead to quick expansion to river basins farther south, such as those of Orinoco. Like other pipids, this is an aquatic species that lives in lakes, ponds, marshes and other flooded areas. It is able to cross land during rains and so can be found in open grasslands and dry or moist savannas, but not in habitats devoid of water (IUCN 2006).

This species is elusive and exceptionally difficult to observe. It is known to exhibit territorial behavior, with males defending underwater calling sites via visual displays, chasing intruders, jump attacking, and wrestling (Duellman and Trueb 1994). 
The reproductive behavior of Pipa parva closely resembles that of other pipids and is nearly identical to that of P. pipa and P. carvalhoi, including the somersault behavior and female dorsal skin brooding. Amplexus is inguinal (the male grabs the female around the waist above the thighs) and occurs while the pair are completely submerged in water. The amplexing pair, led by the female, begins a series of maneuvers where they swim toward (but not reaching) the surface, the female releases eggs mid-way, and then during mid-water turnovers, the male fertilizes the eggs and pushes them into the female's dorsum with his vent region. This cycle is repeated until all the eggs are released, fertilized, and implanted. (Duellman and Trueb 1994). 
After the eggs have been fertilized, they are implanted in the skin of the female's dorsum. The epidermis and dermis of the female's back during this time undergo significant change:  the egg chambers are highly vascularized and adhere to the single jelly capsule of the egg. The small gills of the developing embryos then engage in gas exchange with the vascularized tissue of mother (Duellman and Trueb 1994). In P. parva, along with P. carvalhoi  and P. myersi  and unlike other Pipa, the free-living larval stage is still present. After 30 days of dermal brooding, the tadpoles hatch from the mother's skin. Other pipids such as P. pipa undergo direct development, hatching miniature adult frogs instead of larvae (Duellman and Trueb 1994; Sokol 1977). Because of the increased demands of direct developing young, species with direct development usually have only one annual reproductive cycle. However, species such as P. parva that produce tadpoles are able to reproduce several times a year.  Captive P. parva females have been recorded to produce three or four clutches per year (Duellman and Trueb 1994). 

The tadpoles rest in mid-water with only small and occasional movements of the tail, exercising precise hydrostatic control (Sokol 1977). To feed, these tadpoles employ hyobranchial pumping to gather particles in the water; they are filter feeders. When food is lacking, the larvae attempt to stir the substrate (Duellman and Trueb 1994; Sokol 1977). 

The tails of P. parva tadpoles are long, relatively thin, and taper to a point (MCZ specimens). Both the tail and the lungs are important in hydrostatic stabilization. Tadpoles must fill their lungs before they can swim; if P. parva larvae fail to fill their lungs properly, it is a struggle for them to get to the surface and move about (Sokol 1977).

Pipa pipa can be identified by its large triangular head, small eyes with rounded pupils, and nostrils found at the end of two narrow tubes on the snout.  Its body is flat, brown or olive-colored, and covered by many tubercles.  The front limbs are short and weak with long slender fingers, and the hind limbs are long, strong with webbed feet.


","
Found in sluggish rivers and canals with muddy bottoms throughout South America from Ecuador to Guianas and southward to Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil (Capula 1989).


","
Pipa pipa is entirely aquatic, living on the muddy bottom of tropical rivers.  Using star-shaped tactile organs on its fingertips to detect food, the tongueless Pipa pipa lunges at its prey, consisting mostly of invertebrates.  During the process of mating, the male fertilizes the eggs and then attaches them to the female's back.  The skin of the female then encloses the fertilized eggs.  Larval development occurs within the egg and fully metamorphosed individuals approximately 2 cm in length emerge from incubation after 3 to 4 months.

Typical body shape of a pipid frog; tentacle below eye 0.5 of the eye diameter; foot with three horny claws.
A medium-sized clawed frog with button-like protruding eyes situated dorsally. Body flattened. Adults measure 38â€“60mm (SVL). The subocular tentacles are well developed, reaching about 0.6â€“1 of the eye diameter. The skin is almost smooth. Starting at the posterior border of the eye, a double line of elongate unpigmented flat sensory tubercles (lateral line sense organs) is arranged in roughly alternating order. The outer line comprises 20â€“29 tubercles set at right angles to the body axis. The inner one runs parallel to the latter, comprising about 16â€“20 tubercles. Furthermore, 3â€“7 pairs of these tubercles appear in the neck region, and 10â€“14 ones are found on the border of the lower jaw, set at right angles to the mouth. Like all of the dorsal surface, this part of the skin is scattered with numerous minute asperities which are equally unpigmented. Some of these may also be found on the fingers which are covered with numerous minute grooves. On breeding males, the outer part of the fingers is black. The dermal lobes above the vent are better developed in females. The web of the hind limbs is fully developed. Toes 3â€“5 have black horny claws. Metatarsal tubercle without claw. 2n = 36.
According to Stewart (1967), males from Malawi reach a SVL of 58 mm, females 72 mm. Concurring measurements were published by Nieden (1923), 
Poynton (1964a), 
Arnoult & Lamotte (1968), 
Lamotte & Xavier (1981) 
and Lambiris (1988). 
Poynton & Broadley (1985a) even specify a SVL of up to 80 mm. Smaller frogs, concerning animals from Cameroon, were measured by Mertens (1938a); SVL: males 38 mm; females 57 mm) and by Perret (1966); SVL: males 40â€“49 mm; females 54â€“63 mm). Nieden (1915) mentions a specimen from Tanzania showing traces of a fourth claw.
Coloration: Dorsal parts of body and limbs drab olive with large black patches that are sometimes vaguely defined. The iris shows a silver-grey glimmer. The venter is whitish to orange yellow. Some darker patches occasionally appear on the throat and on the thighs. A single female had the belly scattered with black spots. Distinctive ventral designs were reported from Ghanian frogs (Poynton 1964c). According to Loumont (1984), the dorsal patches of animals from Tanzania, Malawi and Zimbabwe are often arranged in two longitudinal rows. Mertens (1955b) mentions a female from Tanzania whose venter showed smoky-gray patches and a young specimen whose venter was plain white. In alcohol the dorsum turns almost completely gray olive, and the original black patches are hardly visible. The venter turns gray white, and black spots remain visible.
Voice: So far, it has not yet been registered at ComoÃ© National Park. According to SchiÃ¸tz (1963), the call sounds like a rather low ""pink-pink"" resembling the sound produced by a spoon knocking against a pan. According to Vigny (1979), animals from Malawi produce a sequence of rattling ""trra-trra"" calls lasting 0.15â€“0.21 sec, the dominant frequency being 1.1 kHz. She describes two types of calls. Picker (1983) has also published sonagrams. These calls lasts 0.15 to 0.20 sec, comprising 5â€“6 pulses (dominant frequency: 0.8â€“0.9 kHz). Wager (1986) describes the call as ""turrr"", comparing it to the sound produced by a pencil vibrating against a glass pane. According to Lambiris (1988), two soft calls per second are uttered under water. Passmore & Carruthers (1995) report short ""metallic"" calls produced under water at intervals of 0.15 seconds. The vocal apparatus of the male has been examined by Loumont (1981).

This species is quite common in most African savanna regions, south of the Sahara. According to Frost (1985), the range of X. muelleri comprises comparatively arid savannas, from Burkina Faso across the Sudan-Guinea zone to northern Zaire and the East African coast, thus reaching the Republic of South Africa. An isolated population has been recorded from north-eastern Chad. In particular, the species has been recorded from the following countries: Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Congo, ?Gabon, Angola, Chad, R.D. Congo, Central African Republic, southern Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland, South Africa, Namibia (Peters 1882c, Nickel 1901, LÃ¶nnberg 1910, Nieden 1915, Noble 1924, Loveridge 1925, 1929, 1930, 1933, 1936, 1957, Parker 1930, Witte 1934, Mertens 1938a, 1955b, Laurent 1961b, SchiÃ¸tz 1963, 1964a, 1967, Poynton 1964a, c, 1966, 1993, Gorham 1966, Lamotte 1966, Perret 1966, Stewart 1967, Arnoult & Lamotte 1968, Walker 1968, Broadley 1971, BÃ¶hme 1975, Vigny 1977b, Joger 1981, 1982, 1990, Loumont 1984, Poynton & Broadley 1985a, Lambert 1987, Branch 1988, Hughes 1988, Lambiris 1988, 1989, Channing 1989, Channing & Griffin 1993, Simbotwe & Mubemba 1993, Pickersgill 1994, Passmore & Carruthers 1995, BÃ¶hme et al. 1996, RÃ¶del 1996, 1998b).

This species inhabits savanna ponds of highly variable size. During the dry season, X. muelleri is found at the banks of rivers. The data found in the available literature almost exclusively refer to savanna habitats (e.g. SchiÃ¸tz 1967, Walker 1968, Joger 1981, Hughes 1988, BÃ¶hme et al. 1996). Only SchiÃ¸tz (1963) mentions a dry forest habitat where X. muelleri occurs in syntopy with Silurana tropicalis. However, the two species were never found in the same pond, thus resembling very much the situation in ComoÃ© National Park. The data concerning the preferred habitat types are somewhat contradictory. For example, small ephemeral ponds are mentioned by Noble (1924), Loveridge (1933), SchiÃ¸tz (1963), Joger (1981, 1982) and BÃ¶hme et al. (1996), whereas Walker (1968), Broadley (1971), Lamotte & Xavier (1981), Poynton & Broadley (1985a), Lambiris (1988), and Passmore & Carruthers (1995) refer to permanent ponds and lowland rivers as preferred habitats. According to Channing (1989) X. muelleri in Namibia inhabits pans and deep pools, often even in the presence of large fish. Finally, Arnoult & Lamotte (1968) state 

semi-permanent waters. It is very difficult to decide which habitat type is really preferred, as most studies exclusively refer to the actual state of the respective habitat, which may have appeared totally different as it was colonized by clawed frogs. Residuary puddles are mentioned quite regularly, but these are often situated in the dry beds of brooks and rivers. In the ComoÃ© National Park, large but temporary pools are apparently preferred, at least during the breeding season.
","
Spawn: Eggs have not yet been found at ComoÃ© National Park. According to Arnoult & Lamotte (1968), eggs were attached singly to aquatic plants. Swisher (1969) reports that eggs were deposited on rocks and on leaves. Data concerning egg and clutch size are not published. In Xenopus laevis the egg diameter is 3 mm (Rose 1950).


X. muelleri spends the dry season in the bank zone of the rivers, migrating into the savanna as soon as heavy rainfall sets in. I have found them in the gallery forest only during those migrations. As X. muelleri reappears almost immediately even in ponds far away from the permanent rivers, it seems highly probable that some frogs survive the dry season in the mud of those ponds. In Nigeria, SchiÃ¸tz (1963) found animals under humid layers of leaf litter in the dry season. According to Noble (1924) they buried themselves in the mud when ponds dried out. If it happens to rain at night, the frogs often move between different ponds. Drift fences with pitfall traps arranged at one pool have shown that even well-filled ponds are often left and/or re-colonized by these animals. Short migrations made by adult specimens are referred to in Walker (1968), too. According to this author, the species call both during day and night.

Reproduction apparently takes place exclusively in a rather restricted number of ponds, so I seldom succeeded in recording tadpoles of X. muelleri (RÃ¶del 1998b). They seem to be comparatively common in large ponds, but occur occasionally in puddles containing less than 200 l or in residuary ponds, e.g. those found in the dry beds of seasonal brooks. As the tadpoles inhabiting large ponds always form larger swarms whereas those found in puddles are less numerous or even solitary, it is highly probable that the latter have been washed accidentally into these habitats during periods of heavy rainfall. Like the tadpoles of S. tropicalis, those of X. muelleri filter their food in mid-water, swimming either on the spot, or moving forward rather slowly. In flight, however, these animals can reach astonishingly high speeds, jumping occasionally even above the surface. According to Stewart (1967) and Lambiris (1988), the tadpole of this species usually swim horizontally. In ComoÃ© National Park I observed them always with the head directed downward. Stewart (1967) confirms that swarms of 20â€“30 specimens are found mostly in mid-water.

The observations made by Joger (1982) apparently speak in favor of a rather extended breeding season: he found various stages of development in one and the same pond. At ComoÃ© National Park, tadpoles occur throughout the rainy season. The breeding ponds in Ghana are said to dry up before September (Arnoult & Lamotte 1968). In Nigeria, Walker (1968) found numerous mummified tadpoles, mainly during the months of November-December. Noble (1924) identified green algae and diatoms as food items in the alimentary tracts of tadpoles. Adultsâ€™ stomachs contained arthropods and small Xenopus tadpoles. Haagner & Haagner (1997) report on storks preying on X. muelleri in Natal.
","
Tadpoles: A typical pipid larva whose broad mouth resembles that of a catfish, lacking both horny beaks and teeth. Long, thin tentacles are situated on both sides of the mouth, reaching beyond the dorsal base of the tail fins when held against the body. The dorsal fin is considerably less broader than the ventral one. The ventral emargination of the fin between body and vent is rather marked. The tip of the tail is curved upward more visibly than in Silurana tropicalis. The coloration of larvae inhabiting muddy pools is transparent or cream. In rather somber habitats, the entire tail fin shows a blackish hue. Total length is 2.6â€“3 times the body length. The tail height is 2â€“2.3 times the body length. The intestines often shows a silvery glimmer. A paired spiracle is present on the venter.

In 1993, two weeks after the rainy season had set in, we found a larva measuring 60mm (TL) whose limbs had not yet emerged. Two weeks later, the tadpole metamorphosed, having reached a length of 21.8 mm. Some example measures and weights (TL in mm, weight in g): 42/ 0.24; 45/ 0.48; 48/ 0.75; 55/ 0.68; 58/ 1.44; 63/ 1.53; 68/ 1.38; 72/ 1.75. Metamorphosis set in when the tadpoles had reached a TL of more than 5 cm. The largest tadpole ever collected in ComoÃ© National Park measured 100mm, showing fully developed hind limbs. Freshly metamorphosed young measured more than 20 mm. The largest tadpole collected by Noble (1924) measured 87mm. Stewart (1967) writes that the length of the tentacles corresponds to more than Â¼ of the TL. According to Lambiris (1988), tadpoles reach a TL of 70 mm, whereas Arnoult & Lamotte (1968) mention animals measuring 98 mm (TL). According to the latter, the tentacles begin to emerge at a TL of 7 mm (BL: 2.5 mm). At this stage, exterior gills have already been reduced almost completely. Freshly metamorphosed animals are reported to measure 40 mm (SVL, Arnoult & Lamotte 1968).

A big, long-legged ranid frog with a pointed snout and distinct dorsal ridges. SVL of males: 43â€“57 mm; females: 43â€“68 (â€“72?) mm. The large clearly visible tympanum reaches 0.7â€“0.9 of the eye diameter. Two pairs of continuous dorsal ridges. A short ridge between the outer dorsal ridge and the dorsolateral one. Occasionally this ridge may be absent. Some larger warts on the flanks. Males with paired lateral vocal sacs whose slits run from the end of the lower jaw directly to the base of the arm. Thigh length is 0.45â€“0.62 of the SVL; the lower leg measures 0.58â€“0.65, and the foot, incl. longest toe, reaches 0.73â€“1 of the SVL. Fingertips and toe-tips not expanded. The inner metatarsal tubercle is tiny, reaching just 0.2â€“0.4 of the shortest toe length. Webbing formula: 1 (0.5) or (1), 2 i/e (1â€“0.5) or (1.5â€“0.5), 3 i/e (1.5â€“0.5) or (1â€“0.5), 4 i/e (2) or (1) or (0.5), 5 (0.25) or (0.5) or (1). The ventral skin is granulated. The legs of larger individuals are proportionally longer (GuibÃ© & Lamotte 1958a). Patterson & McLachlan (1989) give a median adult SVL of 40.5 mm.

Coloration: The back has a uniform brown basic coloration with a bright vertebral band beginning at the snout tip. The color of this band may be white, beige, yellow, orange or green. Some individuals may lack this band. Several black spots are present on the dorsal ridges. The dorsolateral ridges are light. Animals showing a uniform dark coloration with a fine pale vertebral line are reported to exist, too. The brown tympanum has a narrow pale border and a somewhat paler center. It is surrounded by a dark temporal triangle. The region between nostril and eye is also dark. The vocal sacs are gray. Several white patches occasionally appear on the flanks. The dark bars on the thighs are present only on the anterior part. A thin yellow longitudinal line with black borders runs along the posterior part of the thighs. The light brown shanks invariably show a narrow light longitudinal line. A similar marking may appear on the thighs. The upper lip is bright white, and this coloration is likewise present on the infratympanic ridge stretching to the upper arm. If black bars are present on the shanks, they are usually restricted to the posterior part. Black spots are present on the ventral border of the lower jaw. The throat may be mottled black. The rest of the venter is white to yellowish. The ventral parts of the extremities are white-orange.
Voice: Amiet (1974b) describes the advertisement call as a low nasal ""hoin"". It resembles the call of P. bibroni, but seems to be lower and ""slower"". Lambiris (1989) describes a short and very nasal ""quack"" usually followed by several click sounds. A sonagram has been published by SchiÃ¸tz (1964c), too. According to Perret (1979b), the calls of frogs from South, East and West Africa are identical. The call of Serengeti frogs described by Van Den Elzen & Kreulen (1979) consists of 12 pulses (Amiet/Cameroon: 22) per call and lasts about 0.12 sec (Amiet: 0.15â€“0.2 sec). The dominant frequencies in Tanzanian frogs are 0.5â€“1.2 kHz and 2.3â€“3 kHz (Amiet; 1.3â€“2.3 kHz). According to Passmore (1977), the call of South African frogs comprises 16 pulses and lasts 0.17 sec (dominant frequency: 2.3â€“3 kHz). The differences might be, at least partially, temperature-dependent. Akef & Schneider (1995) described the advertisement call in Egyptian P. mascareniensis. Their frequency range was 0.25â€“3.5 kHz. The calls were uttered in long continuous series from 5â€“10 min. Variation in some calling parameters was temperature dependant.

Similar species: Easily distinguished from Hoplobatrachus tigerinus by the more continuous dorsal folds rather than rows of tubercles.


","
Range: This species has not yet been found at ComoÃ© National Park. According to Frost (1985), it inhabits an enormous area stretching from Egypt to Sierra Leone, Natal and Madagascar. ""P. mascareniensis""-records have been published for the following countries: Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, R.D. Congo, Central African Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Rwanda, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Madagascar (MÃ¼ller 1885b, GÃ¼nther 1895, Nieden 1903, 1910b, 1915, Boulenger 1906, 1910, 1919, LÃ¶nnberg 1910, Chabanaud 1921, Noble 1924, Loveridge 1925, 1929, 1930, 1933, 1936, 1941, 1955a, c, Scortecci 1929, Parker 1930, 1936?a, b, ?c, ?Witte 1934, 1941, ?Sanderson 1936, Mertens 1938a, ?b, 1940, 1955b, ?Monard 1940, Paulian & Vilardebo 1946, Romer 1953, GuibÃ© & Lamotte 1955a, 1957, Perret & Mertens 1957b, Taylor & Weyer 1958, Schmidt & Inger 1959, Inger & Marx 1961, SchiÃ¸tz 1963, 1964a, b, c, 1967, 1968, Euzet et al. 1966, Perret 1966, 1979b, Lamotte 1967a, b, 1971, Stewart 1967, Walker 1968, Maeder 1969, Perret & Amiet 1969, Urban 1969, Broadley 1971, Drewes 1972, Stevens 1974, Amiet 1975, BÃ¶hme 1975, 1978, 1994d, Passmore 1977, Miles et al. 1978, Van den Elzen & Kreulen 1979, Joger 1981, 1982, 1990, Murith 1981, Barbault 1984, Branch 1988, Hughes 1988, Lambiris 1988, 1989, Channing 1989, Patterson & McLachlan 1989, RÃ¶del 1990, 1996 Poynton 1991, Fischer & Hinkel 1992, Channing & Griffin 1993, Simbotwe & Mubemba 1993, Glaw & Vences 1994, Pickersgill 1994, Passmore & Carruthers 1995, Largen 1997a, 1998).

Habitats: This species inhabits humid savannas and forests (e.g. Amiet 1975). According to BÃ¶hme (1994d), it is a savanna species but invades the rainforest via forest lanes. Perret (1979b) reports on similar habitats. He wrote that this frog prefers humid savannas and also invades degraded forests. In Kenya, it is found at elevations of up to 2000 m. According to Lamotte (1967b), it is a forest species. According to my own observation, this holds true for the Ivory Coast. However, it rarely penetrates true rainforest. I found it only at the forest border or on clearings.
Occurs from sea level up to over 2000 m elevation in various habitats.In Africa it lives in agricultural areas, rice fields, secondary vegetation with tall herbaceous vegetation and marshy areas, and is often found near large lakes, rivers and other wetland habitats (including irrigation canals). In Madagascar and the Seychelles, it lives in extremely varied habitats, including rainforest (marginally), dry forest, fields, savannahs, grassland, and urban areas (Rodel et al. 2008).




","
The frogs are active both during the day and at night, preying on locusts, beetles and aquatic invertebrates. According to Inger & Marx (1961), their diet includes mainly, but not exclusively, terrestrial prey. In particular, these authors cite prey of beetles, orthopterans, cicadas, dragonflies, ants, butterflies and amphibians (both tadpoles and young frogs).

Breeding takes place in puddles, ditches, and ruts (Rodel et al. 2008). 

Spawn: At Lamto, Ivory Coast, females produce 1079 eggs with an egg diameter of 1.1 mm (N = 6; Barbault 1984).

Biology: According to Mertens (1938b), the very long breeding period in Cameroon is interrupted only by the dry season. Lambiris (1989) reports on single males calling between vegetation on the edges of ponds. Referring to the coastal region of the Ivory Coast, Murith (1981) writes that P. mascareniensis breeds before and after the rainy period, appearing at the savanna ponds two to three times per year. Compared with my preliminary observations on this species in Tai National Park this statement seems to be very doubtful. In Malawi, these frogs reproduce during and after the rainy season (Stewart 1967). Spawning sites include temporary ponds, car tracks, road ditches and swamps (Mertens 1938b, SchiÃ¸tz 1964c, Perret 1966, Amiet 1974b, Hughes 1988). However, large water bodies such as rivers and lakes are also quoted (Patterson & McLachlan 1989, Fischer & Hinkel 1992). Males call partially submerged between vegetation (Van den Elzen & Kreulen 1979). Lambiris (1989) found these frogs mainly near waters. In Namibia males call from the bank under vegetation or exposed on bare soil or while floating clinging to vegetation (Channing 1989, Channing & Griffin 1993). According to Akef & Schneider (1995), in Egypt calling males were rare in large permanent water bodies. When calling they float on the water surface or sit on the ground. They show little aggressive behavior. The distance between calling males was 50â€“80 cm. The distances in small pools were smaller than in larger ones.
","
Tadpoles: The keratodont formula of the dark gray-brown tadpoles is 1 / 1+1 // 2, very rarely 1 / 2 + 2 // 2 (Perret 1966). The dorsum is scattered with bright brownish spots with a metallic glimmer. The tail length is three times its height, and three times the body length. It is very pointed. The beaks are serrated. Mertens (1938b) mentions a row of papillae only for the lower lip. Lamotte & Perret (1961a) describe papillae that are arranged in one to two rows. Even more rows are present in the corners of the mouth. A rostral gap is present, as in most other tadpole species. According to the above authors, the tail is comparatively short. The forelegs of a tadpole measuring 37mm (TL; BL: 16 mm) were about to emerge (Mertens 1938b, GuibÃ© & Lamotte 1958a, Lamotte & Perret 1961a). Froglets measure 19 mm (Patterson et al. 1989).
","
Least Concern: wide distribution, tolerance of a broad range of habitats, and large population. It occurs in many protected areas (Rodel et al. 2008).

Giant bullfrogs are the largest amphibians found in southern Africa. In Gauteng males reach a snout-vent length of 245 mm and a mass of 1.4 kg. In contrast to most other frogs and toads, males are larger than the females. The head is very broad. Two large bony spines separated by a smaller spine project upwards from the lower jaw. Several prominent, interrupted skin ridges are present on the back. A spade-like inner metatarsal tubercle is present on each heel, and is used for digging (Minter et al. 2004). 
 
In adults, the dorsum is dark olive-green, but may vary from brown to grey and even blue; short sections of the longitudinal skin ridges may be white or cream. In juveniles, a pale vertebral stripe is often present, contrasting sharply with the bright green ground colour. The abdomen is white to creamy-yellow, except in the region of the forelimbs, where it is bright yellow in breeding males.

Male calls from shallow water. Breeding starts after heavy rain initiated by 65 mm of rain over the previous day or two. Breeding during day time, spawning from 7.00 to 16.00. Males have two breeding startegies, depending on their age. Younger males congregate in a small area, perhaps only 1 or 2 square meters of shallow water. The larger males occupy the center of these breeding arenas or leks and attempt to chase off other males. A female approaches the group of males by swimming along at the surface until she is within a few meters of the group. Female dives and reappears on the surface in the middle of the group. She is soon grasped by one of the larger males, and mating ensures. Eggs are laid in the shallow edge of the pond, but fertilization takes place above water level. Eggs are fertilized before they reach the water.  Full grown males are more agressive. They fight, causing injury and even killing one another. The dominant male attempt to prevent other males from participating in breeding. Most of the females are mated by the dominant male in his territory. The dominant male takes care of the tadpoles. Egg laying occurs in a small area, and the tadpoles hatch together. 
 
 
P. adspersus will eat just about anything, and are sometimes cannibalistic. 
 
 
 
 
During the dry season the frogs live underground. P. adspersus can reach an age of 45 years. Predators of the adults are birds and of tadpoles include turtles (Pelusios) and monitors (Varanus niloticus).

  Amolops bellulus  can measure up to 50.1 mm SVL in males and 63.6 mm in females. The head is depressed with a flattened forehead. The tympanum is distinct and very slightly concave.  There is a visible pineal organ.  The snout is rounded and projects beyond the lower jaw. Canthi are distinct, with the loreal region vertical at the canthus but oblique from the canthus to the mouth.  Vomerine teeth are present in two somewhat oblique rows between the choanae. The tongue is shaped like a heart, with a pronounced concavity at the posterior. The body is relatively slender and depressed, with smooth skin except for numerous small tubercles around the vent and the base of the thigh. Wide and flat dorsolateral folds are present, but supratympanic folds and a glandular ridge under the tarsus are lacking. In preservative, the dorsolateral folds may not be evident but the skin along the edge of the dorsum and flanks is thickened (Liu et al. 2000).

 The forelimbs are somewhat long with slender, unwebbed fingers. The third finger is the longest, followed by the fourth, first and second. There are large discs with circummarginal grooves on the three outer fingers; however, the first finger has a small disc with no circummarginal grooves. The three outer fingers also have supernumerary tubercles at the base of each finger. Oval and well-developed subarticular tubercles are present, along with flat, fused palmar tubercles. The hindlimbs are long, with the fourth toe the longest, followed by the fifth, third, second and first. All toes possess discs with circummarginal grooves. All except the fourth toe are fully webbed.  The inner side of the first toe and the outer side of the fifth toe are fringed.  The foot also has oval subarticular tubercles, and a small, oval inner metatarsal tubercle. The outer metatarsal tubercle is lacking (Liu et al. 2000). 

 Vocal sacs are absent; however, A. bellulus males do have well-developed velvety nuptial pads covering the dorsal and medial surfaces of the first fingers (Liu et al. 2000). 
 
The body and top of the head are beige with green and brown spots. Ventrally, the throat and belly are slightly yellowish, with some grayish brown on the throat and anterior chest.  A white band extends along the jaw and from the jaw to the shoulder. A black band runs from the snout tip to the anterior flank, fading to gray at the axillary region. The dorsal flank is brown with green spots while the posterior and lower flanks are bluish-green to olive-green. Limbs are brown dorsally with many olive green spots. Ventrally, the limbs are yellowish with some black-gray.  There are distinct black crossbars on the forelimbs, thigh, tibia, and tarsus. Toe webbing is spotted brown. The upper part of the iris is yellow with some brown spots, while the lower half is dark brown (Liu et al. 2000).  


The tadpole has a large (about 2/3 of the belly), well-defined abdominal sucker, as is characteristic of Amolops larvae.  Tadpoles measure about 36 mm in total length at stage 31 and 63 mm at stage 36. Eyes are small and directed dorsally, with a group of postorbital glands present on each side. The snout is rounded, with the nostrils located slightly closer to the eye than the tip of the snout. The spiracle is on the left. There is a ventral oral disc, with an expanded lower lip and a single row of marginal papillae that has a broad gap anteriorly, as well as submarginal papillae in  a single lateral row on either side. The beaks are keratinized and undivided, with the upper beak curved and the lower beak V-shaped. Denticles are present in two undivided rows,  with the denticle formula being III: 4 + 4/1 + 1:II. The tail has visibly segmented musculature, convex dorsal and ventral fins, with the dorsal fin wider, and ends in a sharp point. In addition to the postorbital glands, scattered dorsal glands are present, and on the posterior of the belly, two groups of ventral glands can be seen (Liu et al. 2000). 

In preservative, the larval color is brown with dark patches (Liu et al. 2000).

","
It has been found Pianma Township, Lushui County, in Yunnan Province near the Myanmar border, at an elevation of 1540 m. It was found in mountain brooks on the western slope of Mt. Gaoligong (Liu et al. 2000). Amolops bellulus may also be synonymous with Amolops gerbillus, which is known from a single specimen in northern Myanmar on the Myanmar-China border, at 1,620 m above sea level. (Smith 1940; IUCN 2006).
","
This frog is a stream-breeding species, hiding underwater by day and visible on large rocks within small streams by night. The tadpole's abdominal sucker and the enlarged finger and toe discs of the adult indicate adaptation to a torrential environment.  Males lack vocal sacs (Liu et al. 2000).
","

","
The locality within China falls within the Gaoligongshan National Nature Reserve (IUCN 2006). This species depends on clear, clean water, since it is restricted to mountain brooks, so degradation of stream habitat would pose a threat (Liu et al. 2000).
","

","
 The specific epithet  bellulus  is from the Latin adjective meaning beautiful.

This species is sympatric with Amolops viridimaculatus, Megophrys minor, Rana arnoldi and Torrentophryne tuberospinia.

  Amolops tuberodepressus  measures up to 56.7 mm in SVL in males, and 71.1 mm in females.  It has a flat, depressed head with distinct canthi and a rounded snout which projects beyond the lower jaw. The tympanum is distinct and covered with smooth skin.  A narrow, slightly curved supratympanic fold runs from the posterior corner of the eye to the shoulder. Vomerine teeth are present in two obliquely oriented rows.  The body is depressed and slender, with smooth skin except for numerous flattened tubercles on the flank (for which the species is named), a few flat tubercles on the dorsum, and many small tubercles surrounding the vent.  Dorsolateral folds are absent (Liu and Yang 2000). 

 The forelimbs are moderately long.  Fingers are slender and the relative finger length is III>I=IV>II.  Large discs with circummarginal grooves are present on the three outer fingers, and a small disc with no grooves is present on the first finger. The third finger disc is larger in diameter than the tympanum.  Subarticular tubercles are rounded and prominent, and there are large supernumerary tubercles at the bases of the three outer fingers. Palmar tubercles are flattened and fused.  Velvety, brownish gray nuptial pads are also present in males. The hindlimbs are long, with the relative finger length being IV>III=V>II>I. All toes have discs with circummarginal grooves, and are fully webbed except the fourth, which is partially webbed. The inner first toe and outer fifth toe are fringed.  While the subarticular tubercles are well-developed, the inner metatarsal tubercle is small and the outer metatarsal tubercle is lacking (Liu and Yang 2000). 

  Amolops tuberodepressus  is brown with round or irregular green to bluish-green spots. The head is more green than brown, while the posterior dorsum is more brownish. The sides of the head and body are green with brown spots. Dorsal surfaces of the limbs are green with brown crossbars, while the ventral surfaces of the limbs are yellow with occasional black-gray. Webbing is yellow to orange-yellow. The belly is cream with a yellowish tinge, fading to gray laterally and on the chest. The iris is brown with yellow spotting (Liu and Yang 2000).   

 In general, females are larger in overall size, while the forelimbs of the males are larger. Males lack vocal sacs but have nuptial pads, which are brownish gray and velvety and cover the entire dorsal and medial surfaces of the first fingers (Liu and Yang 2000). 

","
 The species occurs in the Trans-Himalayas Range in China. It is common in the Wuliang and Ailao Mountains of Jingdong County, Yunnan Province. It resides in wet subtropical broadleaf evergreen forests, on rocks in mountain streams or adjacent to cascades (Liu and Yang 2000). 
","
The frogs flatten themselves onto rocks in mountain brooks or beside cascades. When disturbed, the frogs immediately jump into the water (Liu and Yang 2000). Breeding takes place in June and July (Rao and Wilkinson 2007).  
","

","

","

","
 The specific epithet  tuberodepressus  is derived from the Latin noun  tuber, for tubercle, and the Latin adjective  depressus, meaning flat.

The karyotype is 2N=26.  Karyological characters unique to this species include a strong secondary constriction on the short arm of chromosome pair 2, near the centromere, as well as a distinct secondary constriction in the middle of the short arm of chromosome pair 3.  Also, no sex-related heteromorphic or supernumerary chromosomes were observed for this species.  In common with other Amolops from southwestern China, a secondary constriction is present in the middle of the short arm of chromosome pair 6 (Liu and Yang 2000).

This species was featured as News of the Week: 
 
January 7, 2019: How sex is determined in frogs is complicated. In some species, males have two different sex chromosomes (an XX-XY sex chromosome system, like mammals) whereas females of other species are the sex with two different sex chromosomes (a ZZ-ZW sex chromosome system, like birds). Whether a species has an XX-XY or ZZ-ZW system has changed dozens of times throughout frog evolution. The Japanese wrinkled frog (Glandirana rugosa) is an evolutionary witness to the remarkable complexity of frog sex determination. Some populations have an XX-XY sex chromosome system whereas others have a ZZ-ZW system. In central Japan, there are adjacent populations of wrinkled frogs with different sex chromosome systems. Ogata et al. (2018) recently discovered a hybrid zone where these two populations meet. They found here a ZZ-ZW system but also a hybrid sex chromosome system. In this hybrid population, the Z-chromosome is partially derived from the old ZZ-ZW populationâ€™s Z-chromosome and partially derived from the XX-XY populationâ€™s Y-chromosome. The hybrid populationâ€™s W-chromosome is surprisingly derived from the X-chromosome of the XX-XY population. This work illustrates how the fantastic diversity of sex determining systems in frogs can arise from recycling sex-determining genomic material across populations and species (Written by Max Lambert).

Rana erythraea is sexually dimorphic, with adult females reaching a maximum size of 78 mm SVL, and males reaching a maximum of 48 mm in SVL (Brown and Alcala 1970).  Dorsal coloring varies from light to dark green and the ventral side is generally whitish, although blue morphs have also been reported (as for some other species of ranids; see Berns and Uhler 1966, and the Comments section below).  R. erythraea has cream colored dorso-lateral folds that are sometimes bordered with black. Limbs are yellowish with irregular spotting.  This species has smooth skin, and long, free fingers that dilate into minute discs with grooves.  It has long hindlimbs.  The inner metatarsal tubercle is present, but the outer metatarsal tubercle is absent (Inger and Stuebing 2005). Males are much smaller than females  
(Iskandar 1998), and breeding adult males have velvety yellow nuptial pads on the first finger, extending from the wrist to the end of the first metacarpal (Inger and Greenberg 1963). 
","
This species is found throughout much of southeast Asia, at elevations up to 1,200 m above sea level (Diesmos et al. 2004). R. erythraea occurs in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak), Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore. R. erythraea has also been introduced into Indonesia (Java, Kalimantan/Borneo, Sulawesi: Diesmos et al. 2004) and the Philippines (Diesmos et al. 2006).  It is mostly found in thick floating marsh vegetation or bushes, particularly at the edge of ponds (both artificial and natural), rice fields, ditches and marshes, as well as quiet streams (Inger and Greenberg 1963; Diesmos et al. 2004; Brown and Alcala 1970).  
","
The advertisement call has been described as a ""squeaky warble"" (Inger and Stuebing 2005). Males call while sitting in water, and in Malaysian populations were found to rarely begin calling before 2200 h (Arak 1984). R. erythraea breeds year-round in both Sarawak (Inger and Greenberg 1963) and in the Philippines (Brown and Alcala 1970; Alcala 1955). This species lays a single clutch of pigmented eggs in stagnant water (Iskandar 1998). 

Lifespan in two Philippine populations was reported to be a maximum of 4 years, based on mark-recapture data (Brown and Alcala 1970).  Males in these populations attained sexual maturity at about 6-7 months post-metamorphosis, developing nuptial pads at a minimum body size of 34-35 mm SVL, and females attained sexual maturity at about 9 months post-metamorphosis, at a body size of at least 50 mm SVL (Brown and Alcala 1970).
","

","
This species is abundant in suitable habitat and stable in population (Diesmos et al. 2004).  It is adaptable and can be found near human habitation (Inger and Greenberg 1963). Threats include water pollution from agricultural chemicals and consumption for food by humans (Diesmos et al. 2004).  It is sometimes found in the pet trade but collection levels do not appear to be impacting populations (Diesmos et al. 2004).  Its range overlaps with several protected areas (Diesmos et al. 2004). 
","

","
This species, like a number of other ranid species (Berns and Uhler 1966), is
normally green-colored but occasionally has blue morphs. Skin chromatophores are
responsible for frog coloration and contain three layers: xanthophores,
iridophores, and melanophores.  Xanthophores contain yellow pigment. 
Iridophores contain reflecting platelets full of crystalline deposits and
scatter light so that shorter (blue) wavelengths are reflected.  Melanophores
absorb longer wavelengths of light. Since green arises from a combination of
blue and yellow, frogs (or body parts) that lack xanthophores appear blue
(Bagnara et al. 2007).



For more information on the basis of blue coloration in amphibians (both
adults and eggs), as well as in other vertebrates, see Bagnara et al. (2007).
Other non-ranid amphibians with blue coloration include the blue-spotted

Rana taipehensis has a small, narrow body with a maximum SVL of 40 mm. This species is brightly colored. Dorsally it is yellowish green to greenish brown, with light yellowish brown sides. Paired dorsolateral glandular folds are present as brownish black lines. Front and hind limbs are light brown with dark brown stripes. The abdomen and neck bear tiny spots and have three brownish black stripes each. Slanted dark brown blotches are present at the anterior front. Anterior is white in background mixed with a gray dotted web pattern. The tympanic membrane and the region behind and below it are dark blackish brown in color (Lue 1990).
","
Rana taipehensis is limited to the northern parts of Taiwan, essentially confining the population to Taipei (Lue 1999). Previously, it was present in large numbers in the valleys, but is now rarely seen in the southern parts of Taiwan (Lue 1990). However, this frog is widespread in other parts of Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia (Stuart et al. 2006), China (Yang 2008), Hong Kong, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Stuart 2005), Myanmar (Wogan et al. 2008), Thailand (Chan-ard 2003), and Viet Nam (Orlov et al. 2002; Nguyen et al. 2005).  It may also be present in Peninsular Malaysia but has not yet been recorded there (Van Dijk et al. 2004). Rana taipehensis populates areas from lowlands up to 800 m above sea level (Van Dijk et al. 2004). This species can be found in wet, damp crop fields, ponds, and hills with tea crop plants present (Lue 1990), as well as open grassy wetlands, rice paddies, river floodplains, and swamps in deciduous forests (Van Dijk et al. 2004). 
","
They are found in dense tree masses in groups during the daytime (Lue 1990). Breeding occurs in standing water with thick vegetation at water's edge (Van Dijk et al. 2004).

In areas with increased urbanization (and increased ambient noise), Rana taipehensis have been observed to call at a faster rate. It is not known whether this change in call rate interferes with calls of other species (Sun and Narins 2004).
","

","
The population is currently stable (Van Dijk et al. 2004). It can adapt to a variety of habitats, including agricultural ones (Van Dijk et al. 2004). However, despite its classification as Least Concern, the species is becoming more sensitive to any outside stresses in endangered regions, such as Taiwan (Lue 1990).  It is known to occur within several protected areas (Van Dijk et al. 2004).
","
In some parts of the world, Rana taipehensis is treated as a pest and is eliminated (Lue 1990).  In addition, pollution from insecticides presents a threat (Lin et al. 2008).
","
The status of this species in India is controversial; Frost notes in Amphibian Species of the World that this species has been confused with Rana erythraea and Rana tytleri.

This species was highlighted in News of the Week:
January 29, 2018: Cathelicidins are a family polypeptides, known for their antimicrobial properties, that are found in immune and skin cells. About 30 cationic peptides have been isolated in various vertebrates. However, despite amphibians being known for their complex skin polypeptide secretions, only seven cathelicidins have been identified from five amphibian species. Cao et al. (2017) recently isolated a new cationic peptide, Cathelicidin-OA1, from Odorrana andersonii that possess antioxidant properties but no antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, experiments with Cathelicidin-OA1 on mouse models revealed full-thickness skin wound healing properties, which is a first for amphibian cathelicidins. Cathelicidin-OA1 promoted wound-healing by increasing macrophage recruitment to wound sites, resulting in faster skin cell production and tissue formation. These findings help us better understand this family of polypeptides and promise the development of better wound-healing agents. (Written by Ann Chang)

SVL males: 45-68, females 85-100mm; relatively slim body, snout lightly pointed; legs remarkably long. First finger shorter than or as long as second, fingers and toes with broadened roundish or slightly pointed flat discs, all toes with dark webbing that nearly or completely reaches the discs; skin of back rough like grained leather; dorsolateral fold shows more or less distinctly, tympanum round, no tympanal fold. Males have clearly larger tympana, callous thumbs and paired gular vocal sacs. 
 
Males are uniform green in various nuances, with dark spots or dots, dark dorsolateral stripes, completely dark or dark with green spots; the back is usually a different color than the sides. Dark stripes from the tip of the snout to the eyes; tympanum brown or dark gray, with a green center; lips white to light brownish. Legs often with dark cross banding; belly dark with bright dispersed areas that range from white to light gray. 
 
 Females with a lesser ability to change color; individually with varied coloration, back mostly green; predominantly with dark stripes from tip of snout to the eyes, tympanum sometimes bright red, sides sometimes yellow with green areas to uniform green, yellow with white and light gray areas or brownish; some individuals completely light brown on sides and back. Extremities brownish, green or gray, usually with dark cross banding. Belly usually whitish, with gray clouding, especially in the throat area.   
 (Manthey and Grossmann 1997).     
 
 

","
Occurs in the south of Thailand, west Malaysia as well as on the west Malaysian islands of Pulau Pinang and Pulau Tioman. Occurs on Borneo, Java, Sumatra and Pulau Sumeulu. 
Rana hosii prefers fast flowing, clear waters with rocky edges in forest areas (up to 1500m). Grossmann and Manthey (1997) observed females near rainwater streams in a meadow on the Bukit Fraser (west Malaysia) at night. The frogs are most abundant near waterfalls. During the day, males can be found hiding among the rocks along the banks. When disturbed, they jump into the water and swim upstream with a few short strokes to climb up onto the nearest rocks. Females spend the day in branch axles and bushes at 1 to 2m high (Manthey and Grossmann, 1997)[815]. 
 
 

","
Regardless of season, males call in a high frequency that penetrates the noise of the waterfalls. The call is reminiscent of chirping birds and can be heard during the day as well. Females lay their eggs, 500-2000 at a time, in coherent clutches directly into the water. The male immediately grabs the female in an axillar amplexus that can be maintained for several hours.  
Diminutive white larvae hatch from the white eggs after 6-10 days. During their development the larvae's color changes through several shades of gray. They reach a total length of 38mm (SVL 11mm). The mouth is located ventrally. The tooth formula for young larvae is 5 (2-5)/4 (1), while that of the older larvae is 6 (3-6)/4 (1). Newly metamorphosed  Rana hosii have a SVL of about 10mm and are dark gray. The back turns green with dark spots within a few weeks (Manthey and Grossmann 1997).

This species was featured as News of the Week on 11 November 2018:

Ring species, complexes of populations that differentiate genetically around a natural barrier, should be relatively common based on the large array of natural conditions suitable for their formation. So their rarity may be due to scientists discovering only isolated parts of rings and not recognizing the piecemeal parts for the whole. The Sichuan Basin in China is a predicted site for ring species formation, and a new paper by Qiao et al. (2018) argues that the frog complex Odorrana margaratea is a ring species. The species has a ring-shaped distribution and the chain of populations maintains a mostly gradual and continuous genetic connection, except where differentiated populations meet secondarily in the northwestern part of the ring. Two refugial components are thought to have separated, differentiated and later reconnected. In the southeast, a genetic ""melting pot"" occurs in the secondary contact region, but in the northwest there is partial reproductive isolation, supporting the ring-species hypothesis (Written by Dave Wake).

","
Diagnosis: Odorrana schmackeri is a smaller species than Rana andersonii and R. margaratae, and is distinguishable from R. margaratae by the presence of a feeble tarsal fold and a larger tympanum, which is about three-fourths the length of the eye. O. schmackeri is distinguishable from R. andersonii by its smaller size and the presence of spines on the throat and thorax, whereas R. andersonii has spines only on the belly. Digital disks are also further developed in O. schmackeri than R. andersonii. The vocal sacs of male O. schmackeri may be discerned externally and the sides of the body are smoother than those of R. andersonii. O. schmackeri is characterized by very obvious brown or black round spots on the head and back, and such spotting is less consistent in R. andersonii (Liu 1950).

Description: O. schmackeri has a snout-vent length of approximately 42 mm. It is characterized by the presence of vomerine teeth, an oblique loreal region that is somewhat concave, the nostril being closer to the snout than the eye, a narrow interorbital region, and a distinct tympanum. The canthus rostralis is obtuse. The first finger is longer than the second and the fingers have expanded discs. The toes are webbed and the species has an indistinct inner metatarsal tubercle, but no outer tubercle. The skin is smooth or slightly corrugated (Boulenger 1920).

Coloration: It has a bluish green-grey dorsum, with black marbling. Its head and back also have brown or black spots. The sides have sharply defined round black spots and the limbs have dark cross-bars. The glandular fold below the tympanum is greenish white. The ventral sides are dirty white and the limbs are orange (Boulenger 1920). 

 Variation: Males have vocal sacs and spines all over the throat, thorax and belly. The body length in males is in the range of 37-46 mm (Liu 1950).

","
O. schmackeri can be found in several provinces throughout central China, including in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces (Lau et al. 2004), particularly near torrent streams near Mount Huangshan in China (Yu et al. 2006).


","
O. schmackeri is an unstudied species of frog, but skin peptides from this species have been shown to have nucleic acid sequences that are encoded by hypervariable antimicrobial peptide-encoding domains (Chen et al. 2006). 

Odorrana schmackeri is capable of hearing much lower auditory frequencies than are heard by sympatric torrent species O. livida and Amolops tormotus. It does not respond to higher frequencies than 8.5 kHz, suggesting that the three species have unique responses to selection pressures (Yu et al. 2006).

","

","
O. schmackeri is threatened by dam construction, development and harvest for consumption. Additionally, it is a bycatch of fisheries (Lau et al. 2004).
","
Frogs are harvested for consumption and are a bycatch of fisheries (Lau et al. 2004)


","
Species Authority: Boettger, 1892.

Phylogenetic Relationships: The genus Odorrana and Eburana were initially both subgenera of Asian cascade frogs, within the genus Rana. After the first investigation of phylogenetics, Eburana was placed within Odorrana. In the light of phylogenetics, subgeneric reassessment of Southeast Asian Rana has been suggested (Matsui et al. 2005). Relationships within Odorrana have been found to coincide well with distribution patterns, indicating the Guizhou Plateau as the center from which the group radiated (Ye and Fei 2005)

Males average 32.5 mm in SVL while females average 56 mm in SVL (Feng et al. 2002). The head width is about the same as the head length (Fei 1999).  The tympana of males are sunken, while female tympana are not (Fei 1999).  Vomerine teeth are present (Fei 1999). Tiny small bumps are present on the dorsum, with the sides and venter bearing numerous, densely concentrated small warts, and scattered small warts are present on the throat (Fei 1999).  Dorsolateral folds are present (Fei 1999). Fingers are about half as long as the toes (Fei 1999).  The ground color is tan, with occasional black dots on the dorsum. A dark brown stripe runs from each side of the snout to the eyes, broadening behind the eye, running across the top of the ear canal, and continuing as an interrupted dark streak following the dorsolateral fold.  Both forelimbs and hind limbs are barred.  The venter is light yellow (Fei 1999). The top third of the iris is gold, with the bottom third dark brown, so that the stripe running from the snout appears to continue through the eye.  A white stripe runs from the snout along the upper lip, continuing to the shoulder.

Males have ear canals with recessed tympanic membranes at the end of the canals, like mammals but unlike all other anurans except for Huia cavitympanum (Feng et al. 2002).  In Odorrana tormota, the tympanic membranes have been shown to be exceptionally thin, which facilitates transmission of high-frequency sounds to the inner ear (Feng et al. 2006).  The middle ear bones (ossicles) are reduced in both size and mass, due to the shortened distance between the tympanum and inner ear; this also facilitates high-frequency sound transmission (Feng et al. 2006).

    Males also have two pairs of vocal sacs (Feng et al. 2002). In addition, the larynx appears to be specialized for production of ultrasound frequencies and the generation of calls with nonlinear features such as subharmonics and chaos (Suthers et al. 2006). These specializations include variations in thickness along the lengths of the vocal cords, and reverse size dimorphism, with males having smaller larynxes (about half as large as that of the female), unlike other anuran species (Suthers et al. 2006).  
","
This species has a restricted distribution within China, in Zhejiang Province (Jiande and Anji counties) and Anhui Province (Huangshan).  It occurs between 150-700 m in elevation (Feng et al. 2002).  It resides in vegetation along permanent streams and waterfalls running through mountains and hills, in subtropical/tropical moist lowland forest and shrubland (Feng et al. 2002).
","
This frog is one of only two anuran species (the other being Huia cavitympanum) that has been shown to communicate using ultrasound (frequencies above 20
kHz), which is extremely unusual in non-mammalian vertebrates (Feng et al. 2002; Feng et al. 2006; Arch et al. 2008). Male Odorrana tormota make melodic calls resembling those of birds, with distinct frequency modulations that are primarily in the audible range (5-9 kHz) but often reach into the ultrasonic range (Feng et al. 2002; Feng et al. 2006; Arch et al. 2008). 

Males are territorial and call from low vegetation adjacent to noisy streams, with calling males spacing themselves at about 1.5 m apart (Feng et al. 2002).  The calls consist of either two notes of short tone ""pips"" or a single note with short or long duration, all of which have very variable components (Narins et al. 2004). However, unlike other anurans, which have a limited repertoire of calls typical of each species, Odorrana tormota has a vocal repertoire that cannot be accurately estimated in size; analysis of 12 hours of tape from 21 calling males revealed no two calls alike (Feng et al. 2002).  (In contrast, the frog Boophis madagascariensis from Madagascar makes 28 distinct calls, by far the most previously described for any anuran species (Narins et al. 2000).) 
The unusually rich and complex vocal repertoire of Odorrana tormota  shares aspects of passerine bird, primate, or whale sounds, such as ultrasonic components, musical warbling (multiple upward and downward frequency modulation sweeps), and sudden onset/cessation of selective harmonic components within a single call note (Feng et al. 2002).  Males have two pairs of vocal sacs, which contributes to the harmonic complexity of the call (Feng et al. 2002), as well as a specialized larynx (Suthers et al. 2006). Laryngeal specializations include unusually intricate vocal cord morphology, with varying thickness along their length; very thin portions of the medial vocal ligaments appear to contribute to ultrasound production (Suthers et al. 2006). Both the ultrasound frequencies and the nonlinear dynamics (subharmonics and chaos) associated with the calls of this species may thus arise from complex nonlinear oscillatory patterns of the vocal cords (Suthers et al. 2006). In addition, there is reverse sexual size dimorphism of the larynx; unlike all other frogs examined to date, which have larger larynxes in the male than the female, in O. tormotus the male larynx is smaller than that of the female (Suthers et al. 2006). Interestingly, most of the acoustic features present in normal male Odorrana tormota vocalizations can be generated by forcing airflow through the larynx of a euthanized frog (Suthers et al. 2006).

Electrophysiological recordings from the auditory midbrain confirm that this species can hear as well as generate ultrasound (Feng and Narins 2007).  Hearing in this species spans the range from less than 1 kHz to about 35 kHz (Narins et al. 2004; Feng et al. 2006), which is a considerably higher range than had previously been thought to exist for anurans (up to 5-8 kHz, Fay 1988; Loftus-Hills and Johnstone 1970). It is not known what organ within the ear is responsible for ultrasonic sensitivity (Feng et al. 2006). Frogs have two known auditory organs, the amphibian papilla, which responds to low/intermediate frequencies, and the basilar papilla, which responds to high frequencies (Feng et al. 1975; Lewis and Narins 1999).  The upper limit for frog hearing was previously thought to be 8.2 kHz, based on the sensitivity recorded for basilar papilla nerve fibers (Loftus-Hills and Johnstone 1970). Thus either the upper frequency sensitivity has been dramatically increased for the basilar papilla in this species, or another as yet undescribed mechanism is responsible for the detection of ultrasonic calls (Arch et al. 2008). 

 In addition to being heard, the ultrasound components of the call do function in male-male interaction, since playback of both ultrasonic and audible components of recorded calls evoked vocal responses from males (Feng and Narins 2007).


While ultrasound is used and perceived in male-male territorial interactions in this species, it is not clear whether ultrasound is also involved in male-female communication.
Males have recessed tympanic membranes, whereas females do not (Chen 1991). 

This species shelters in moist rock crevices during the day, and is found in thick brush alongside streams at night (Fei 1999). 

The reproductive season begins in June.  Eggs are milky yellow in color, and measure about 2 mm in diameter (Fei 1999).

This species (Odorrana tormota) was formerly known as Amolops tormotus.

The two frog species with ultrasound communication (Odorrana tormota
and Huia cavitympanum) are both found in Southeast Asia but are neither
sympatric nor
closely related (Cai et al. 2007; Stuart 2007).  Rather, they are found in
similar habitats, with males calling adjacent to noisy, rushing streams (Arch et
al. 2008).

A related species from the same province, Odorrana livida,  also has the ability to detect ultrasound, as shown by recordings from the auditory midbrain.  Odorrana livida has very thin, transparent tympanic membranes, but in this species the membranes are not recessed.  It has not yet been shown whether Odorrana livida is also emitting ultrasonic frequencies in its calls (Feng et al. 2006).

The frog lives in Japan, Korea, China (Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Juangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang provinces, as well as Ningxia-Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions) and the former Soviet Union. In the latter area, the range is subdivided into two main parts: the Far East and Turkmenia. In the Far East, the frog is distributed in the valleys of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers and their tributaries. The westernmost Far Eastern known locality is Khinganskii Nature Reserve in the Amur Province (49Âº05'N,130Âº36'E). Tadpoles of the Dark-Spotted Frog were introduced in 1959 - 1961 with herbivorous fish fry from China (Hubei Province) into ponds of the Karamet-Niyaz Settlement, Kerki District, Turkmenia. Since the introduction, the species has successfully populated this locality. However, this population does not disperse along the Kara-Kum Channel over long distances. 
The Dark-Spotted Frog lives in meadows, different types of forests, bushlands and in desert (Turkmenia). Within these landscape types, it inhabits different types of water bodies, including river pools, channels, lakes, ponds, swamps, ditches and rice fields. In Turkmenia, the frog is strictly associated with riparian, overgrown parts of ponds, channels and irrigation ditches, whereas in the Far East it regularly occurs 2-15 m from water. In general, however, this frog displays a high site-fidelity. As a rule, it uses stagnant waters, rarely occurring in the shallows of rivers, covered with dense vegetation. It should be noted that in Turkmenia this species lives mainly separately from its relative, the autochthonous Marsh Frog (Rana ridibunda). Only in few ponds do these two species co-occur. 
 
 
 
 

","
Over a large part of the range, the Dark-Spotted frog is a common species, but the distribution in many areas is patchy, i.e. the frogs occur in dense groups. Hibernation occurs from late September - November to February - May in water, generally in large stagnant ponds and lakes, but sometimes in streams. Reproduction occurs soon after hibernation. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary). The clutch contains 600-5000 eggs. Metamorphosis occurs from May to August, depending on latitude and altitude. Sexual maturity is probably attained at an age of 2 years; maximum longevity is estimated to be 13 years.  
Tadpoles consume primarily plants (algae etc.). Adults primarily eat spiders, terrestrial insects and other invertebrates. Vertebrates (fish fry, amphibians etc.) are rarely eaten. Feeding does not cease during the breeding season. 
 
 
 
 

","

","

The species often occurs in anthropogenic landscapes, including towns and cities. There is a tendency towards dispersal of the species in the Far East.

Rana plancyi is a large sized frog (85 mm SVL for females and 50 mm SVL for males). It has a pointed snout in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct.  Paired dorsolateral glandular folds are wide and distinct (Lue 1990).
The dorsum and sides are grassy green with thick golden brown stripes on the dorsum running from snout to vent. Ventrally, Rana plancyi is white (Lue 1990).

","
This species is present in Taiwan (primarily the mid-northern regions) and the eastern provinces of China, including Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and possibly Jiangxi. It is uncertain whether this species is present in Korea (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008).  Rana plancyi is more commonly found in plains and hills at lower elevation, closer to sea level (Lue 1990), but does occur up to 1,200 m asl (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008). It is found in ponds (particularly lotus ponds), paddy fields, and ditches (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008). 
","
R. plancyi can be easily observed both at night and during the day. It leaps into the water when approached by potential predators (Lue 1990). Breeding is in still water (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008).
When viewed dorsally, Rana plancyi generally assumes a triangular position with its legs as the base (Lue 1990).

","

","
Although this species is common, it is declining. Water pollution and urbanization, along with consumption and trade in China are thought to be causing the decline. It does occur within a number of protected areas (Pipeng and Changyuan 2008).
","
In 2007, a case study was reported where a 70 year old man was thought to have contracted eosinophilic meningitis from ingesting a raw Rana plancyi frog infected with rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). However, more research is needed to confirm that the parasite is actually contracted through ingestion and not just through direct contact (Lai et al. 2007).

Rana amurensis lives in West and East Siberia, the Russian Far East, Korea, Northern and Central Mongolia, and Northeastern China. This is one of the most widespread amphibians of the Palearctic. The northern margin of the range runs in Russia: northeastwards from Sverdlovsk Province (the westernmost localities are environs of Turinsk Town: 58Âº02'N, 63Âº41'E and Lenino Village in Tavda District) to Tyumen Province (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous County, lower Irtysh River - northwards along the rivers Irtysh and Ob to Batovo Village and Pasnokort Settlement in Oktyabrsk District - Yamal-Nenets Autonomous County, Nadymskii Nature Wildlife Sanctuary: ca. 65Âº33'N, 72Âº29'E). Then the margin turns southeastwards to the southern part of the Krasnoyarsk Region (Boguchan District) and Irkutsk Province (area of the Ust-Ilim Town: 58Âº00'N, 102Âº36'E). Then the margin runs northeastwards in Yakutia, approximately along the line: upper flow of the Vilyui River - upper flow of the Markha River - Zhigansk Town on the Lena River (ca. 67ÂºN, 124ÂºE) - upwards by the Lena River to Siktyakh and Buuru settlements - Khaiyr Lake in the lower Omoloi River area (ca. 71ÂºN, 133ÂºE). Then the margin runs southeastwards approximately along the line: Verkhoyansk District, Tylgys Settlement (30 km north of the Arctic Circle) - Verkhnekolymsk District, Usun-Kyuyol Settlement (ca. 67Âº40'N, 155ÂºE) - Magadan Province (Srednekansk District, Balygychan and Seimchan Settlements, ca. 63ÂºN, 152ÂºE). Then the margin runs southwards to the shore of the Sea of Okhotsk. There is some information on the occurrence of this frog even further north than the known localities. This information needs further verification. 
The southern margin of the range runs in Russia approximately along the line: Sverdlovsk Province (Turinsk Town) - northeast of Kurgan Province - south of Tyumen Province - Omsk Province - Novosibirsk Province - Gornyi Altai Republic (right bank of the lower Katun River, foothills of Altai Mountains: ca. 52ÂºN, 86ÂºE) - Kemerovo Province - Khakassia Republic - south of the Krasnoyarsk Region - southwest of Irkutsk Province - Republic of Buryatia, then to Mongolia (forest steppe and steppe zones: Kharkhorin Town - Tuul River - Kherleen River), China (Inner Mongolia Autonomous District, as well as Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Shaanxi provinces) and Korea. Both the northern and southern margins of the distribution need further exploration. The rarity and sporadic distribution of the species in those areas provide obstacles for such exploration. 
Rana amurensis lives in coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forests, within which it penetrates the tundra and forest steppe zones. It occurs most frequently in open, wet places such as wet meadows, swamps, overgrown shores of lakes, riverbanks, and open areas in forests with abundant vegetation and arboreal debris. The connection with water bodies (overgrown river valleys with floodplain ponds and lakes) is especially typical in the southernmost (forest steppe and steppe) and the northernmost areas. In the south of the Primorye Region, this species avoids dense forests and occurs mainly in wet meadows with secondary small-leafed forest or shrub in river valleys. Reproduction occurs in shallow lakes, ponds, large puddles and swamps with stagnant water.

The Siberian Wood Frog is a common or abundant amphibian. Its population density through large areas reaches several hundred or thousands individuals per hectare. At the same time, in the northernmost and the southernmost areas the species forms dense but small populations in suitable habitats, and the overall abundance should be considered low. 
Hibernation occurs from early September - early November (usually October) to March - early June (usually April- May), depending on latitude. The frog hibernates in holes at the bottom of lakes and rivers, and in wells, usually in groups up to a few thousand individuals. Terrestrial hibernation seems to be more typical for southern regions. 
Reproduction takes place from March - April (usually May elsewhere), whereas in cold northern areas the breeding season may extend until the first half of July. Breeding choruses are absent; the species belongs to the group of ""mute"" brown frogs. Amplexus is pectoral (axial). The clutch contains 250-4000 eggs deposited in 1-2 clumps. Metamorphosis occurs from June - August. The maximum age was determined as 5-11 years old in different regions. 
The larvae of R. amurensis consume mainly algae growing on underwater substrates (Phaeophyta, Zygnemales and Bacillariophyta), as well as higher plants, detritus and small aquatic invertebrates. Juveniles consume mainly terrestrial insects, but sometimes also aquatic arthropods. Adults consume mainly terrestrial invertebrates and the diet varies by season and habitat. The frog sometimes eats aquatic prey. The latter (Mollusca, Gerridae, Dytiscidae, Haliplidae and larval Odonata) are especially important in the northern part of the frog's range. Small amounts of aquatic organisms have been found in the stomachs of frogs caught at breeding ponds. 
 
 
 
 

","

","
There are no recorded overall changes in the population number of this species throughout the range. However, local declines related to human activity are known: there are reports on the negative influences of construction of dams on large rivers in Siberia, as well as drainage of breeding pools and mass collecting for education. 
 
 
 
 

","
Rana amurensis often occurs in anthropogenically altered landscapes, especially open areas: hayfields, pastures, overgrown quarries, kitchen gardens etc. Its populations even occur in some settlements and cities.

Northern margin of the range extends from the Southwestern Norway, Central Sweden and Finland to Northwestern Russia. There, the margin runs from Murmansk Province, then approximately along the line: Arkhangelsk Province (Pinezhskii Nature Reserve - south of the Kanin Peninsula - Nenets Autonomous County) - Komi Republic (Vorkuta City: 67Âº29'N, 64Âº00'E) - Tyumen Province (Yamal-Nenets Autonomous County, Kharvuta Settlement on the Khadyta-Yakha River) - Krasnoyarsk Region (Taimyr Autonomous County).

The Moor Frog inhabits the zones of tundra, forest tundra, forest, forest steppe, and steppe. In Europe, the frog generally inhabits drier and more open sites than the Common Frog (Rana temporaria), including forest edges and glades, swamps, meadows, fields, bushlands gardens, etc. In Siberia, the species lives mainly in open swamps. The frog penetrates tundra and steppe in association with arboreal vegetation, primarily along intrazonal landscapes of river valleys. At the southern and northern limits of its range, in tundra, forest, and true steppes, the species lives near water bodies: rivers, lakes etc. There the populations of R. arvalis seem to be isolated. Spawning and early development occurs in stagnant waters, including lakes, ponds, swamps, puddles and ditches, which are from several meters to some hectares in area and from few centimeters to two meters in depth.





","
Rana arvalis is one of the most abundant amphibians in the Central and Eastern Europe, as well as West Siberia. There, its population density reaches several hundred individuals per hectare. Local density may be higher, such as in breeding ponds where 15-20 individuals per 1 m2 can be found. In the forests of the center of European Russia, it usually prefers more open habitats than the sympatric Common Frog, and is rarer than the latter in the north, whereas the proportion gradually changes to the south and southeast in favor of R. arvalis,> and at the south of the zone of sympatry it significantly outnumbers R. temporaria. The proportion of the two species varies also by year, and in some areas the dominance of one or another species alternates. Density-dependent regulation is important in overcrowded tadpole groups, where several hundred individuals per liter sometimes occur, as well as in the dense groups of recently metamorphosed froglets. However, habitat peculiarities and fluctuations in weather and climate appear to be more important in terms of the overall population dynamics.

The Moor Frog in the European region is probably a more thermophilous species than the sympatric Common Frog. It frequently occurs in warmer and drier microhabitats. Hibernation extends from September - November to February - June, in dependence on latitude. The earliest appearance (February) and latest disappearance (late November - December) takes place in the plain areas at the southwest of the species distribution, whereas the latest appearance (June) and earliest disappearance (September) is in the Polar Urals. Reproduction occurs from March - June, usually some days after the end of hibernation. Males form breeding choruses. Amplexus is pectoral (axial). The total duration of the breeding season within a pond is 3-28 days. Eggs are deposited in shallow, well-warmed sites, during both day and night. However, spawning by the Moor Frog peaks later than that of the Common Frog; it prefers more open and shallow wetlands for reproduction. The clutch contains 500-3000 eggs deposited usually in one, rarely in two clumps.

Metamorphosis occurs from the beginning of June to October in different regions. In general, the duration of development before metamorphosis shortens in the north and the south of the distribution. Formation of dense schools of tadpoles, where density-dependent regulation of development takes place, is typical. The density does not influence larval survival rate directly but influences the probability of successful metamorphosis because fast developing tadpoles often complete their transformation, while slowly developing individuals die in drying wetlands. ""Delayed"" larvae metamorphosed into froglets at significantly smaller body sizes and possessed less energy reserves. This may be evidence of lower viability. However, in good living conditions, their compensatory growth may enable them to reach the size of specimens from early clutches. However, this compensatory growth takes place relatively seldom, and more often the growth does not depend on individual size after metamorphosis. Sexual maturity is attained in the 2nd-5th year of life. On average, females mature later and have a longer life span than males. The maximum life span recorded for this species is 11 years old.

Moor Frog tadpoles eat Chlorophyta, Cladocera, and other algae, higher plants, detritus, as well as small amounts of invertebrates. Recently metamorphosed froglets forage on Acarina, Collembola and other microarthropods. Adults consume mainly terrestrial prey, aquatic invertebrates (slugs, diving beetles etc.) are consumed in smaller proportions and, as a rule, irregularly. Feeding ceases during the reproductive season.





","

","
The species is generally neither declining, nor threatened. However, isolated peripheral populations may be vulnerable from human influences and deserve special attention or protection. Only in some areas highly transformed by people (destruction of breeding ponds and adjacent terrestrial habitats, especially during urbanization, recreation and the overpasturage of cattle) have the populations declined.





","
In addition to the above mentioned anthropogenic factors of the species local declines, industrial pollution also negatively affects populations, including those living in cities. It leads to an increase of frequency of morphological abnormalities and disturbances in embryonic and larval development. Nevertheless, R. arvalis is a species easily adaptable to life in anthropogenic conditions. Some urban populations of this species are fairly large and safe, if suitable habitats are available. Some forms of human activity lead to an increase in the frog's number and their dispersal. For example, the construction of forest rides with numerous artificial holes filled with water.

The frog was also recorded from the whole of the valley of the Ili River from the mountains to its mouth on the southwestern shore of Balkhash Lake. At present, the species is no longer recorded in a large part of the Ili River valley, Lepsa River, and the shores of Lake Balkhash. It was also known around its shore northwards to Tas-Aral Island near the northwestern shore of the lake in Dzhezkazgan Province of Kazakhstan, as well as in the basin of Lepsa River from the northern slopes of the Junggarian Alatau Ridge to the river mouth on the southeastern shore of Balkhash Lake. The frog may be found also in the basins of the Aksu and Karatal rivers (Kazakhstan) which flow into this lake on its southern shore. The easternmost known locality is Bakhty Settlement in the southern foothills of Tarbagatai Ridge, Semipalatinsk Province (ca. 46Âº40'N, 82Âº40'E).  Further surveys are necessary, because the range margins of this frog are insufficiently known. The problem of a possible zone of sympatry of this species with the Moor Frog (Rana arvalis) in Eastern Kazakhstan deserves special study. 
Rana asiatica lives mainly in wooded areas in river valleys within mountains, steppe and deserts. In mountain areas, it lives in swampy areas with seepage water in hollows, canyons, valleys and meadows. In lowlands and foothills, it occurs mainly in meadows and bushlands near ponds, streams, ditches and other sources of water. Such water bodies are frequently temporary and fill with water only after the spring floods. After the water has disappeared, the frogs migrate to other water bodies. In arid areas, the main type of habitat in this species, dense and high riparian vegetation with numerous small ponds and swamps, is quite fragmented, which is reflected high extent of fragmentation of the species range. For spawning, the frog chooses large puddles, swampy pools, flooded ponds, weakly flowing brooks etc. with a soft, muddy bottom, clean water and dense herbaceous vegetation. 
 
 
 

","
At present, R. asiatica is not very common; its population density reaches usually several dozens of individuals per hectare in Kazakhstan, and more at some sites in Kirgizia. However, in the past its density reached few hundred individuals per hectare. 
Hibernation occurs from September - November to February - March. Hibernation occurs in stagnant or slow-moving waters, usually in groups of several dozen individuals. The frog rarely hibernates on land. Breeding occurs from mid-March - April and until June in highlands. Breeding choruses are absent. Amplexus is pectoral (axial). The spawn is deposited in a single clutch of 600-1700 eggs, but in some cases several portions can be deposited. Metamorphosis in the highlands occurs in August-September, later than in the foothills (late May - June). The maximum age of adult frogs was estimated as 5 years. 
Tadpoles eat detritus, algae (mainly Bacillariophyta and Cyanophyta), pieces of higher plants and, in smaller amounts, small aquatic invertebrates. Adult frogs consume almost exclusively terrestrial arthropods. 
 
 
 

","

","
The existence of isolated populations of the Central Asiatic Frog in arid zones makes them very sensitive to anthropogenic alteration of the environment. For example, during the last 60-70 years the frog has became very rare or extinct in Central Kazakhstan, where it was common. This was caused by flooding of riparian groves (tugai) after the construction of Kapchagaiskoe Reservoir. The species may have also been extirpated from areas adjacent to Balkhash Lake. The displacement of R. asiatica by the introduced and dispersing Marsh Frog (Rana ridibunda) in the areas of Issyk-Kul Lake (Kirgizia) and the Ili River valley (Xinjiang) is likely. 
 
 
 

","
Rana asiatica does not avoid anthropogenic landscapes and occurs in gardens, parks, near wells and irrigation ditches. However, populations are very vulnerable to anthropogenic alteration of the landscape, because the arid regions of Central Asia seem to be the zone of the ecological extreme for brown frogs. During the last years, collecting of the Central Asiatic Frog from the Ili River valley (Uigur District, Kazakhstan) for the purposes of Chinese and Uigur traditional medicine has increased. Such collecting may be dangerous for small, isolated populations of this species. 
 
 
 

","
The species needs special measures of protection in Kazakhstan, China and Kirgizia in the near future.

Adult R. aurora range from 4.4 to 8.4 cm in length, with females significantly larger than males (Stebbins 1985; Hayes and Miyamoto 1984).  

The abdomen and underside of hind legs is characterized by a red or pinkish color, often set on a yellowish ground color (Stebbins 1985). Back is a brown, gray, olive, or reddish color, often with may small black flecks and irregular dark splotches, in some individuals forming a network of black lines (Stebbins 1985). 

  Dorsolateral folds are prominent.  

Tadpoles range in length from 14 to 80 mm, and are a dark brown or olive, marked with darker spots (Storer 1925). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
R. aurora ranges from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, south along the Pacific coast, west of the Cascade Ranges to Northern California. R. aurora  live in areas subject to temporal and spatial changes, and therefore make use of a variety of habits, consisting of both aquatic, upland and riparian (Draft Recovery Plan).  Adults breed in ponds or deep pools in slow-moving creeks.   Where ponds are seasonal in nature, thickets and logjams along riparian corridors provide important non-breeding habitat.  Populations are most likely to persist in areas with multiple breeding sites surrounded by suitable non-breeding habitat (N. Scott and G. Rathbun in litt. 1998). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
R. aurora  breed during a 1-2 week period between January and March, depending on locality (Stebbins 1985; Nussbaum et al. 1983).   Nelson et al. (2017), using passive acoustic monitoring devices, have shed light on this cryptically breeding ranid dispelling previous notions of their natural history. They found that red-legged frogs actually breed over the course of at least 32 days instead of a brief two week window as previously thought. Most interestingly, they report that underwater chorus length lasted nearly 8 hours on average, with a maximum chorus length of 14 hours over the course of a single day! Their acoustic analyses also showed calling effort was affected by temperature specifically reduced by cold snaps. 

Egg masses consist of between 300 and 5,000 eggs (Recovery Plan for the California Red-legged Frog 2002; Storer 1925; Fellers unpubl.).  Egg masses are nearly always attached to emergent vegetation, submerged beneath the surface in the deepest water available (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984; Licht 1969; Storm 1960).  Eggs hatch after 6 to 14 days depending on water temperature ( Jennings 1988). 

Larvae typically metamorphose in 3.5 to 7 months ( Storer 1925; Wright and Wright 1949), 
 but some overwinter and transform after more than 12 months in the larval stage (Fellers et al. in press).  Males may attain sexual maturity at 2 years, females at 3 (Jennings and Hayes 1985), 
 and adult frogs may live 8 to 10 years.  (Jennings et al in lit 1992). 
 
Larvae are thought to be algal grazers ( Jennings et al in lit 1992), and the adult diet consists mostly of invertebrates.  Pacific Tree Fogs (Hyla regilla) and California mice (Peromyscus californicus are occasionally consumed by adult frogs ( Hayes and Tennant 1985). 
  
Juvenile frogs may be active both nocturnally and diurnally, whereas adult frogs are primarily active nocturnally ( Hayes and Tennant 1985). 

The primary predators on R. aurora include garter snakes (Thamnophis spp.), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and great blue herons (Ardea herodias).  Less frequently, red-legged frogs are eaten by American bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus), black-crowned night herons(Nycticorax nycticorax), and rarely by red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus)(Jennings and Hayes 1990; Rathbun and Murphy 1996).  Other introduced species such as the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) and non-native fish also prey on the frog. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
Many factors are contributing to the decline of R. aurora  populations, the main being habitat destruction and degradation.  Introduced predators and perhaps disease have also contributed to the decline of this species (Fellers et al in press) 

Rana aurora is of particular conservation concern in the Pacific Northwest, where their population has decreased in abundance and in site occupancy in recent years. Nelson et al. (2017), used passive acoustic monitoring devices to show that the species breeds longer than previously thought (see Life History) and demonstrated the importance of continued acoustic monitoring for this sensitive species,  especially because conservation strategies often rely on occupancy and detection surveys. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
The primary impact from humans has been from direct habitat loss, especially the construction of houses, shopping centers, and roads.  Much of the range of R. aurora  has been historically grazed, both by dairy and by beef cattle.  Cattle grazing in riparian zones causes serious damage to the vegetation, stream channel, and water quality. R. aurora  may have benefited from beef cattle grazing due to the increased number of stock ponds that are maintained for the cattle.  
R. aurora  are also threatened by a number of introduced (non-native) species, some of which are regularly introduced by humans.  These include sunfish, bass, trout, mosquitofish, and bullfrogs (Fellers et al in press). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
R. aurora  differs from its close relative, the California red legged frog, R. draytonii  in several ways.  Adult R. draytonii  are 35 to 40 millimeters longer than adult R. aurora  (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984). 
 The dorsal spots of R. draytonii  are more numerous, and usually have light centers (Stebbins 1985). 
 R. draytonii  also has rougher skin, shorter limbs and smaller eyes than R. aurora  (Stebbins 1985). 
 R. draytonii  has paired vocal sacs and typically calls from the air , while R. aurora  lacks vocal sacks ( Hayes and Krempels 1986; Licht 1969). 
  Egg masses in R. draytonii  are deposited such that the mass floats at the surface (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984), 
 whereas  R. aurora  submerge the mass in deeper water (Licht 1969; Storm 1960). 
  R. draytonii  breed from November to April (Storer 1925), 
 while R. aurora  breeds from January to March (Nussbaum et al 1983).

A medium sized frog. Gray, brown, reddish or olive above; sometimes plain-colored but more often spotted and mottled with dusky hues.  Colors usually harmonize with the prevailing color of rocks and soil and can be quite cryptic.  Yellow extends from the underside of the hind legs onto the lower abdomen.  Snout with a triangular, usually buff-colored patch from its tip to a line connecting the eyelids.  Throat and chest often dark-spotted.  Skin, including the eardrums, granular.

Range:  West of crest of Cascade Mountains, Oregon, south in coastal mountains of California, to San Gabriel River, Los Angeles Co.; Sierra Nevada foothills to about 1830 m (near McKessick Peak, Plumas Co.); San Pedro Martir (lower end of La Grulla meadow, 2040 m), Baja CA. Isolated populations in Elizabeth Lake Canyon and San Gabriel River drainage (near Camp Rincon), Los Angeles Co,; Sutter Buttes, Butte Co., CA (Stebbins 1985).  The Camp Rincon population is perhaps now extinct (Lind et. al. 1996).  A single record 8 km north  of Lodi, San Joaquin Co., CA, perhaps a stray from the Sierra Nevada foothills (Lind et. al. 1996).  

Habitat:  Streams and rivers in woodland, chaparral, and forest (Stebbins 1985). Found near water, especially near riffles where there are rocks, rocky subtrate, and sunny banks.  When frightened, these frogs will dive to the bottom and takes refuge among stones or vegetation, remaining still (Stebbins 1985).  
 

","
Breeds from the latter part of March to the first of May.  Females oviposit eggs in shallow water toward the margin of streams, attached to sides of stones in the stream bed.  Eggs are laid in clusters (Wright and Wright 1949).  
Voice is seldom heard.  It is a guttural, grating sound either at one pitch or with rising inflection, a single croak lasting 1/2-3/4 of a second.  Four or five croaks may be given in rapid series followed by a rattling sound, with the entire sequence lasting about 2.5 seconds (Stebbins 1985).

This is a California species of special concern  (Lind et. al. 1996) and in 2023, various distinct population segments (DPS) were listed as Federally endangered and threatened.  Notable declines in southern California and the west slope drainages of the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Mountains (Lind et. al. 1996).  

Threats:  Construction of dams.  Predation by bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), a non-native species (Lind et. al. 1996).  
 
Throughout much of the Pacific Coast and Sierra Nevada drainages, the once abundant Foothill Yellow-legged frog has been disappearing, mainly due to habitat destruction, water diversion and pollution. In 2005, only 30 California sites had populations of 20 or more adults, including in the heart of their range in Californiaâ€™s north coast where the frogs have lost a quarter of their historic sites. On December 14, 2016, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) formally petitioned the US Fish And Wildlife Service (USFWS) to list the Foothill Yellow-legged frog as a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act. This joins the the CBDâ€™s 2012 petition for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. In September 2023, the USFWS listed distinct population segments (DPS) in the South Sierra Nevada mountains, and the South Coast of California as Endangered and populations in the North Feather River and Central California Coast as Threatened (see News of the Week below).

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced that it will provide US Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections to many Foothill Yellow-legged frog populations including ESA endangered status for distinct population segments (DPS) in the South Sierra Nevada mountains, and the South Coast of California. The USFWS also granted threatened status for the populations in the North Feather River and Central California Coast.  The ESA is a federal law enacted in the United States in 1973 to protect and recover species at risk of extinction and to promote the conservation of ecosystems and habitats necessary for the survival of those species. The Foothill Yellow-legged frog, named for its yellow belly and undersides of its rear legs, ranges from Oregon state to southern California, and is considered an ecological â€œsentinelâ€ species serving as an important indicator for the ecological health of communities. While wide-ranging, the amphibian faces multiple threats, including altered waterflows from dams and diversions; competition with and predation by non-native species such as American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) and crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus); disease (e.g., chytridiomycosis); precipitation and temperature changes related to climate change; high-severity wildfires; water-related recreation; and habitat conversion and degradation. This is a positive step to address the critical declines of a wide-ranging frog.  (Written by Vance Vredenburg)

Amphibians dwelling in Mediterranean climates are adapted to hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters, but climate change is intensifying the cycle of droughts and floods in these habitats.  How do riverine frogs persist when surface flow becomes intermittent? Kupferberg et al. (2021) investigated this by mapping frog distribution in habitat mosaics created by seasonal drying of stream channels in two San Francisco Bay Area watersheds (California, USA). They monitored populations of the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog (Rana boylii), an imperiled species indigenous to rivers and streams of California and Oregon, and found that although water may not last long enough after spring egg-laying for tadpoles to reach metamorphosis during droughts, the drying appears to allow co-existence with the invasive North American Bullfrog (Rana (Aquarana) catesbeiana).  Bullfrogs can tolerate the fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, while Rana boylii is vulnerable to its lethal effects. In the autumn when frogs concentrate at remnant pools and cold snaps occur, conditions are ripe for transmission of pathogens and juvenile frogs succumb to disease. Despite local die-offs and episodes of poor recruitment, more than two decades of monitoring revealed that R. boylii populations can rebound after wetter winters that create sufficiently long hydroperiods for tadpoles to reach metamorphosis.

Rana boylii, the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog of Oregon and California, is a declining species considered to function as a ""sentinel"" for assessing ecological health of stream ecosystems. Its phylogeography was studied using a large dataset (RADseq) in a landscape genomics approach (McCartney-Melstad et al. 2018). The five primary clades are extremely differentiated, with about half of the range occupied by a rather genetically uniform population. The peripheral clades are hierarchically substructured and should be treated as separate management units for conservation purposes (rather than previous watershed units). The species is apparently extinct in southern California and the southwestern-most peripheral clade in Monterey County is near extinct and shows the lowest genetic diversity. This study finds Foothill Yellow-legged Frog to be one of the most genetically diverse frog species and points the way for improved species recovery targets (Written by David B. Wake).

The effects of dams are well documented on fish species (e.g., salmon) but less is known about how dams affect amphibians. A paper in Conservation Biology shows that dams negatively affect river-breeding frogs in California, such as Rana boylii. Kupferberg et al uses 20 years of frog breeding data from regulated (dammed) and unregulated (un-dammed) rivers to show that by altering the flow regime, dams are causing higher egg and tadpole mortality. Dammed rivers that add artificial peak flows in summer months, for example for boating recreation, have the worst impact on native amphibians. (Written by Vance Vredenburg)

The range of the forms designated here as R. chensinensis covers a large part of China (Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, as well as Tibet, Ninxia-Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions) and Eastern Mongolia. The species lives mainly in wood regions, but also occurs in unwooded areas. It displays a high ecological plasticity living in a variety of habitats. This frog lives in forests of different types, bushlands, swamps and marshes, near mountain and plain streams and brooks etc. In China it seems to be more of a mountain than plain dweller. 

","
The frog is not rare in many places (the abundance may exceed a hundred individuals per hectare), but peripheral populations seem to be small and isolated. The appearance after hibernation and the reproduction takes place from February to June, depending on latitude and altitude. Males form breeding choruses. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary). The clutch contains 800-1500 eggs. Metamorphosis takes place in summer. 
Tadpoles feed mainly upon algae, detritus and higher plants, adults upon invertebrates, mainly arthropods. In dry, steppe regions this frog spends a considerable part of time near water bodies, and aquatic organisms (e.g., Gammaridae) comprise a considerable part of its diet. 

","

","
Rana chensinensis does not avoid human inhabited areas and often occurs in anthropogenic landscapes, where it is subject to the same threats as majority of other anurans. In addition, this frog is used in traditional Chinese medicine. Special farms are used for breeding of this frog in China. 

","
Rana chensinensis belongs to the 'brown frog' species group. In the past (and sometimes at present), these frogs have been considered as the species R. temporaria Linne, 1758. Later studies revealed R. chensinensis to be a species complex, studies of which are in progress. These studies have revealed significant genetic and morphological distinctions between populations from the type territory of Rana chensinensis David, 1875 sensu stricto (Shaanxi Province of China) and the populations of the Rana chensinensis complex from other areas, including those in China (e.g., Beijing area). Consideration of some of these populations as separate species now is more or less commonly accepted (R. ornativentris, R. dybowskii, R. pirica); status of others is the subject of discussion. Here I conventionally use the species name R. chensinensis for those populations of the R. chensinensis complex whose taxonomic status remains unrevised.

The Agile Frog is widespread in Europe, from Southern Sweden (Oland Island) through Denmark, Northern France, Northeastern and Central Germany, parts of Austria, Hungary and the south of Ukrainian Carpathians. The species inhabits the Balkan Mountains southwards to the north of Asia Minor. The species is distributed very unevenly, being absent from a large areas within the range.
As a rule, the species inhabits leafed forests, consisting largely of oak and/or beech, hornbeam, ash etc. These forests often contain a thick layer of leaf litter. Reproduction occurs in well-illuminated and warm swamps in the forest or on forest edges. Such habitats are usually covered with dense herbaceous vegetation. In the south of its range, the species reproduces not only in stagnant but also in slowly running waters.






","
Rana dalmatina is active during the first half of the day and at twilight. During the reproductive period, it is active throughout the day and night. If the frog perceives danger, it escapes by very long, 1-2 m, and high, to 1 m, leaps. Hibernation starts at the end of September - end of October and lasts until late January - March. Reproduction usually occurs in March (sometimes February) to April. Breeding choruses are not formed. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary). The clutch contains 450-1800 eggs. Eggs are deposited at night on underwater vegetation in the most open parts of the pool. Metamorphosis occurs from late June to the beginning of August (and sometimes to October). Some tadpoles overwinter. Sexual maturity is probably attained in the third year of life; the maximum known age is 7 years. Adult R. dalmatina primarily consume terrestrial insects, whereas earthworms, spiders, myriapods etc. are rarely eaten.






","

","
In many sites the species has declined and some populations were extinct during the last decades. Habitat alteration seems to be the main threat for this species.
In the British Isles, R. dalmatina is restricted to Jersey. The species in this region had undergone such great decline that at one time it only bred in a single pond on the island. Efforts by Jersey environmental and conservation groups have successfully reintroduced breeding populations to several locations, including newly created and formerly occupied ponds (John W. Wilkinson & John Buckley, FrogLog 2012).

Although the frog lives in many anthropogenically changed landscapes, it seems to possess lower potential for synanthropization than many other brown frogs of the Palearctic.

Rana japonica has a slender body with a long narrow head.  The average snout-vent length is 48 mm for males and 54 mm for females.  Females are usually much larger than males.  The body color is usually reddish brown with sparse black bands on the limbs and lateral side of body.  Distinct black bands are seen along the canthus and behind the eyes, surrounding the tympanum.  Circular tympanum is about 4/5 of the eye diameter.  The skin of the back is nearly smooth with a few dermal ridges on the side.  Dorsalateral folds are clearly visible.  Webs are moderately developed.  Males develop yellowish brown nupital pads during the breeding season. Neither males nor females have vocal sac or vocal opening.  Mating call is clear and consists of ten to twenty notes.  A single note lasts as long as 2 seconds.               
","
Rana Japonica occurs in Honsyu, Shikoku, and Kyusyu in Japan and southern region of China.  Within Japan, Rana Japonica inhabits mostly in hillsides and plains, and is rarely seen in mountain ranges.  
","
The breeding season is January to March, the earliest of all frog species in mainland Japan.  Rana Japonica migrates from hillside to the breeding sites.  Spawning usually occurs in shallow still water of rice paddies or marshes.  The water temperature in the breeding season is around five to ten degrees.   
 
Occasionally, the breeding season of Rana Japonica overlaps with that of Rana ornativentris.  However, interbreeding rarely occurs because of the distinctively different mating calls.  Interbreeding does not result in hybrids, but is experimentally shown to cause male infertility.   
 
The egg mass is shaped like a smashed ball, about 10 cm in diameter, and contains 500-3,000 eggs.  The egg mass is deposited directly to the bottom of the spawning site.  In some years, the water temperature drops rapidly and freezing kills developing embryos.  Metamorphosis takes place between May and June.  Half of the froglets becomes sexually mature by late October of the same year.  The rest of the froglets mature in the following year.   
 
After completion of egg-laying, mature R.japonica become dormant underneath the mud of the rice-paddies or streams.  In May, they become active again and migrate back to the hillside or plains.  It is not clear whether or not R.japonica hibernate during the winter months.          
 
R.japonica prefer to feed on small animals, such as spiders, Diptera, Coleoptera and insect larvae.

Rana longicrus is a medium-sized frog, with a maximum SVL of 55 mm; females are larger than males. The snout is pointed in lateral view and acute in dorsal view. R. longicrus has a long narrow body with slender limbs. Fingers and toes are rounded, but do not have enlarged tips. The skin has a smooth texture with indistinct small black bumps (Lue 1990). 

Female Rana longicrus are bright red, while males are yellow or brown. On the head, black stripes are present near the eyes. Lips are black with white spots all over. On the dorsum, black spots form the shape of the Chinese character for ""eight"". Front and hind legs have crossbars (Lue 1990).
 
The tadpole of Rana longicrus has a rounded body, small mouthparts, and a high tail fin. Two black spots are visible on the dorsum (Kuramoto et al. 1984). 
","
Northern and central parts of Taiwan. Rana longicrus has a fragmented distribution (Stuart et al. 2008) and is more abundant in the northern parts of Taiwan, primarily in the mid-mountain ranges (Lue 1990).  It has been recorded below 1000 m asl, in broadleaf forest as well as in cultivated fields (Stuart et al. 2008). 
","
In daytime, Rana longicrus hides in shrubs near water bodies. When approached by potential predators, Rana longicrus will leap into the water. This frog is usually found both singly and in groups (Lue 1990). It breeds in ponds, marshes, and pools (Stuart et al. 2008).

Rana longicrus is commonly preyed upon by snakes in Taiwan, especially during the warmer summer months (Mao 1970).

The Columbia Spotted Frog is a large frog, and range in colors from brown, tan, or gray with irregular-shaped black spots with light-centers. The undersides are cream colored with an orange or salmon-colored pigment usually present on the hind legs and lower abdomen. In some Nevada populations the hind legs and abdomen of frogs are yellow. The hind legs are relatively short relative to body length and there is extensive webbing between the toes on the hind feet. The eyes are upturned. Females may grow to approximately 100 mm (4 inches) snout-to-vent length, while males may reach approximately 75 mm (3 inches) snout-vent length (Nussbaum et al. 1983; Stebbins 1985; Leonard et al. 1993).

Canada and the United States. Ranges from southeastern Alaska down into Canada (southwestern Yukon, northern British Columbia, western Alberta and east to Saskatchewan) and into the United States (Washington, east of the Cascade Mountains, eastern Oregon, western Montana, southwestern Idaho, central Nevada, western and north-central Wyoming, and north-central Utah (Wright and Wright 1949; Stebbins 1985; Green et al. 1997). In Washington, the species is known to occur at elevations ranging between 520 m (1720 feet; near Rock Lake, Whitman County) to 950 meters (6400 feet; at Hartâ€™s Pass, Whatcom County) (Leonard et al. 1993). 

The Columbia Spotted Frog is a highly aquatic species and nearly always is found in close proximity to water. Breeding habitats include a variety of relatively exposed, shallow-water ((Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp.). After breeding is completed, adults often disperse into adjacent wetland, riverine and lacustrine habitats. 


","
The timing of breeding varies widely across the species' range owing to differences in weather and climate, but the first visible activity begins in late winter or spring shortly after areas of ice-free water appear at breeding sites (Licht 1975; Turner 1958; Leonard et al. 1996). In Washington's Columbia Basin breeding typically occurs in late March or April, but at high-elevation montane sites breeding does not occur until late May or early June. 

Adults exhibit a strong fidelity to breeding sites, with oviposition typically occurring in the same areas in successive years. Males arrive first, congregating around breeding sites, periodically vocalizing ""advertisement calls"" in a rapid series of 3 to 12 ""tapping"" notes that have little carrying power (Davidson 1995; Leonard et al. 1996). It is unknown to what extent the weak calls serve to attract females, but they may serve to distribute males at the breeding sites thus minimizing maleâ€“male encounters. As a female enters the breeding area, she is approached by and subsequently pairs with a male in a nuptial embrace referred to as amplexus. From several hours to possibly days later, the female releases her complement of eggs into the water while the male, still clinging to the female, releases sperm upon the ova. 

Columbia Spotted Frogs have a strong tendency to lay their eggs communally and it is not uncommon to find 25 or more egg masses piled atop one another in the shallows. The egg masses are deposited in still, shallow water, either atop matted grasses or freely floating among clumps of herbaceous wetland plants. The water levels at breeding sites is usually so shallow that the upper portions of the egg masses protrude above the water surface. This habit often results in severe egg mortality from freeze-thaw damage or desiccation if temperatures fall below freezing or if rain ceases for a prolonged period during the embryonic period. 

After a few weeks, thousands of small tadpoles emerge and cling to the remains of the gelatinous egg masses. After several days the small hatchling tadpoles begin swimming and feeding upon algae, detritus, and in some cases, bacteria, using their minute brush-like mouthparts. In the Columbia Basin tadpoles may grow to 100 mm (4 inches) total length prior to metamorphosing into froglets in their first summer or fall. At high-elevation montane sites, however, tadpoles barely reach 45 mm in total length prior to the onset of metamorphosis in late fall.  

Mortality of eggs, tadpoles, and newly metamorphosed frogs is high, with approximately 5% surviving the first winter (David Pilliod, personal communication). At low-elevation sites sexual maturity is probably attained in two to three years, while three or four years may be required at high-elevation sites (Turner 1960; Licht 1975).

Food includes arthropods (e.g., spiders, insects), earthworms and other invertebrate prey (Whitaker et al. 1982). In turn, Columbia Spotted Frogs may be preyed upon by mink, river otter, raccoon, herons, bitterns, corvids, and garter snakes, while larvae may be consumed by larvae of dragonflies, predaceous diving beetles, fish, garter snakes, and wading birds. 


","

","
Its range overlaps with a number of protected areas.  Northern populations seem to be stable but other populations are declining, especially in some areas of Utah and Wyoming and possibly Idaho.  Threats include habitat degradation from cattle grazing,  agriculture, and logging as well as oil and gas exploration, and depletion of water tables and spring habitat from water development and diversion for irrigation.  Pollution from mosquito control agents might be a threat (Hammerson 2004).  

In a novel approach to understanding gene flow between populations of R. luteiventris in the Bighorn Crags, Salmon River Mountains, Idaho, Murphy et al. (2010) have used gravity modelling (previously used only in economic geography and transportation analyses).  Functional connectivity between R. luteiventris-occupied sites was found to be positively correlated with site productivity (measured by heat load index) and frost-free period between sites.  Functional connectivity was negatively correlated with local presence of predatory trout, between-site distance, and between-site topographic complexity.  The authors concluded that Bighorn Crags populations were already inhabiting very marginal habitat, due to climatic, thermal, and topographic factors, and that infrequent bursts of successful reproduction were sustaining these populations. Thus stresses that may push them over the edge (metaphorically) include the presence of introduced predatory trout and climate change, if pond permanence and moisture availability in dispersal habitat are reduced.

Since nearly the time of its original description in 1853, the systematics of the ""Western Spotted Frog"" group has been a source of some confusion and debate. In 1996, however, a team led by David M. Green published the results of a study on the genetics of Spotted Frogs and concluded that the group actually contained two ""sibling"" speciesâ€”the Oregon Spotted Frog and the Columbia Spotted Frog  (Green et al. 1996, 1997). The decision to ""split"" the species was based upon the results of laboratory studies that indicated significant genetic differences, despite a lack of reliable morphological differences. Because the two species have allopatric ranges, they may be reliably identified based upon the location where a frog is encountered.

How will increasing temperatures from the climate crisis impact amphibian aging and mortality? Despite its relevance to conservation, little data exists on the relationship between temperature and senescence in free-living animals. Cayuela et al. (2021) studied pairs of frogs from two families divided by 100 million years of evolutionary history to answer this: Rana luteiventris and R. temporaria  (Ranidae) and Anaxyrus boreas and Bufo bufo (Bufonidae). The North American toads (Bufonidae) represented sampling along a climatic gradient, whereas the ranid frogs represented sampling from climatically contrasted sites. They found that actuarial senescence ratesâ€” i.e., the rate at which mortality increases with ageâ€” increased with the mean annual temperature experienced in all species. In all species but Anaxyrus boreas, increasing temperatures corresponded to decreasing lifespans. These relationships are presumably attributed to amphibians' increasing pace of life with increasing temperatures; they are active for longer periods, have a higher metabolism, lower mitochondrial efficiency, and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly. The impacts of increasing temperature on these frogs might be exacerbated by increasing evaporative water loss and influenced by genes involved in adapting amphibians to warmer conditions. In the ranids studied, the authors found increasing temperatures flipped sex differences in senescence rate in R. luteiventris but not R. temporaria. These results paint a grim picture for amphibians as global temperatures increase. Amphibian aging is expected to accelerate, with potential skewing sex ratios in some species.

Amphibians may be affected by climate change more than other terrestrial vertebrates, and they have the higher rates of decline in recent years. The Columbia Spotted Frog (Rana luteiventris) is a widespread North American frog that occurs across a variety of climate gradients, from subalpine forests to semi-arid deserts.  Pilliod and colleagues (2022) marked 15,885 adult Columbia Spotted frogs with subdermal transponders, with 33% recaptured at least once during their long term study (11-16 years depending on site). Within each population, adult survival and recruitment rates respond uniquely to seasonal temperature and precipitation variables, especially in winter and spring. Seasonal rain is a weak predictor of adult survival but was a useful predictor of juvenile recruitment, especially in three of the populations. Recruitment rates for each population peaked with different environmental gradients, depending on the amount of winter snowfall, and fall temperature and moisture levels. Thus recruitment may be responding to local conditions independently within each population. Their work emphasizes that local conditions and climate gradients need to be accounted for when managing climate effects on populations of amphibian species with broad geographic ranges.

Rana ornativentris is a broad bodied frog.  The mean snout to vent length for males is 48 mm (range 42 - 60 mm), and for females it is 68 mm (range 36 - 78 mm). The canthus is blunt, and the tympanum is circular. This species has 3 - 7 vomerine teeth.  The tips of the fingers and toes are blunt, and the webbing is well developed.  The skin on the back of this species is slightly rough because of the small tubercles or granules. There is a pair of vocal sacs and openings at the corners of the mouth (Maeda and Matsui 1990).  

The males have a silver-gray colored throat and nuptial pads that are grayish brown (Maeda and Matsui 1990).



","
The species is found on the islands of Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Sado in Japan.  Rana ornativentris inhabits plains, hillsides, and mountainous regions that are up to 1,900 m (Maeda and Matsui 1990).



","
This species has a mating call that lasts 0.5 seconds with 5 - 6 distinct notes.  The breeding period is between January and late June, generally in rice fields, small pools, and marshes.  1,000-1,900 dark brown colored eggs are laid, which are 1.5 - 2.4 mm in diameter (Maeda and Matsui 1990).


The food it eats includes insects, snails, earthworms, and slugs (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

This robust frog may be brown, reddish-brown or red above with a variable number of large, black spots and blotches on the back, sides, and legs. The spots are usually irregular-shaped, with indistinct edges and light  
centers. The skin on back and sides is often covered with small bumps and tubercles. The eyes are upturned. The lower abdomen and the undersides of the hind legs are usually colored by a reddish-orange or salmon-colored pigment that appears as though it has been painted on (Leonard et al. 1993; Nussbaum 1984; Stebbins 1985). Oregon spotted frogs have relatively short hind legs and extensive webbing between the toes of the hind feet. Sexually mature females range between 60 and 100 mm snout-vent  
length and males range between 45 and 75 mm (Licht 1975).

The Oregon spotted frog once occurred from southwest British Columbia through western Washington and Oregon into northeastern California. Today the species is known from three localities in British Columbia, four localities in Washington and approximately twenty-four localities in Oregon (Marc Hayes pers. comm.) (McAllister and Leonard 1997; Green et al. 1997).  
In Washington, it occurs at elevations ranging from 40 to 620 meters (McAllister and Leonard 1997) .  
 
Oregon spotted frog populations occur in association with relatively large wetland complexes. Breeding occurs in shallow, relatively unshaded emergent wetlands. The breeding ponds, which are typically dry by mid- to late summer, range in depth from 2 to 14 inches during the breeding season, and are vegetated by low-growing emergent species such as grasses, sedges (Carex spp.), and rushes (Juncus spp.). After breeding adults disperse into adjacent wetland and riparian habitats. Adults remain active year-around  
near sea-level, but freezing temperatures apparently cause adults and juveniles to hibernate in streams, oxbows and springs at higher elevations.  
 
 
 
 

","
Breeding occurs sometime in February or March at lower elevations, but does not occur until March or April at the two Washington sites in the Cascade Range (McAllister and Leonard 1997). The Oregon Spotted Frog exhibits strong fidelity to breeding sites and eggs are often deposited the same locations in successive years. 
 
Males arrive first, gathering in ""lek-like"" groups  and float in the shallows, calling while awaiting the arrival of a female. Male advertisement calls, consisting of a rapid series of 5 to 50 faint ""tapping"" notes notes, are given  
throughout the breeding season (particularly on sunny days) and again in fall (Davidson 1995; Leonard et al. 1997). Most breeding takes place within a two-to-three-week ""window"" when most of eggs are deposited. However, breeding may be interrupted for up to several weeks by the onset of cold weather; in such cases a second bout of breeding may occur. Upon release, the ova are tightly packed in a mass roughly the size of a ping-pong ball, but within a few hours the mass swells to the size of an average-size human fist. Females usually lay their eggs atop or adjacent to other egg masses (some of the larger aggregations may contain more than 100 individual egg masses). The egg masses are not attached to vegetation, but are deposited in still, shallow waters atop submergent herbaceous vegetation or freely floating amongst clumps of emergent wetland plants such as sedges (Carex spp.) and rushes (Juncus spp). Often-times, the the upper portions of the egg masses protrude above the water surface resulting in severe egg mortality from freeze-thaw damage or desiccation.  
 
After a few weeks of embryonic development, thousands of small tadpoles emerge and cling to the remnants of the gelatinous egg masses, their densely packed, dark bodies acting as solar collectors and warming the water adjacent to the mass. After several days, the hatchlings become free-swimming tadpoles, using their minute brush-like mouthparts to feed upon algae, detritus, and, in some cases, bacteria (but see McDiarmid and Altig 1999).  
Tadpoles may grow to 90 mm total length before metamorphosing in their first summer or fall (Licht 1975) .  
 
Mortality of eggs, tadpoles, and newly metamorphosed frogs is high, and it is likely that only about 1% of an annual cohort survive to the first winter (Licht 1974) . Near sea-level sexual maturity is attained at age two, while at higher elevations one or  
two additional years is required (Licht 1975).  
 
Adults feed upon arthropods (e.g., spiders, insects), earthworms and other invertebrate prey. In turn, Oregon Spotted Frogs may be preyed upon by mink, river otter, raccoon, herons, bitterns, corvids and garter snakes (Licht 1974) , while larvae may be consumed by larvae of dragonflies, predacious diving beetles, fish, garter snakes and wading birds.  
 
 
 
 
 

","

","
This species is rare and has undergone significant declines in range over the past half century. It is now presumed to be extirpated in California and is in serious jeopardy in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. The most probable cause for this frog's precipitous decline is the hydrological modification and destruction (draining, flooding, and filling) of specialized shallow-water, emergent wetlands used for breeding. However, introduced predators including bullfrogs and sport fishes pose serious threats from predation and from competition for critical habitats.

The Commom frog inhabits Europe from the Pyrenees to the Urals and West Siberia. The species inhabits almost all of western Europe except for Portugal, Central and Southern Spain and Italy, Greece (except for the most northeastern part), Southern Ukraine, and Southern European Russia. Southern margin of the range runs eastwards from Central Moldavia to the south of Ukraine (eastwards approximately along the line Odessa Province - Nikolaev Province - Kirovograd Province - Zaporozhie Province), then northeastwards approximately along the line: center of Dnepropetrovsk Province - Kharkov Province (Kharkov City, 50Âº00'N, 36Âº15'E), then in Russia: Byelgorod Province - south of Kursk Province. Then the margin runs eastwards to Voronezh Province, then northeastwards through Tambov Province to Penza and Ulyanovsk provinces, then southeastwards in Samara Province (Samara City: 53Âº12'N, 50Âº10'E) and Orenburg Province in the Southern Urals. From there, the frog penetrates Northwestern Kazakhstan (Uralsk Province, Dariinsk Settlement in the middle stretch of the Ural River: ca. 51Âº10'N, 51Âº40'E). From Orenburg Province of Russia, the margin rounds the Ural Mountains from the south and runs eastwards to northern Kazakhstan (Kustanai and Kokchetav provinces). At the southern limit of its range, the Common Frog is distributed unevenly and there is a tendency towards decline and extinction of some geographical populations and isolation of others.
The northern range limit extends from the southern shore of the Barents Sea and the northern shore of the White Sea. In the Kola Peninsula, the margin corresponds to the Barents Sea coast from the Norwegian border to the area between Kharlovka and Voyatka rivers, then southwards to the northern coast of Kandalaksha Bay. Southeastwards, in Arkhangelsk Province, the margin corresponds to the coast of the White Sea, including the Kanin Peninsula. From the latter, it runs southeastwards and eastwards through Komi Republic in Russia, approximately along the line: lower Shapkina River in Ust-Tsilma District (ca. 67ÂºN, 53ÂºE) - Vorkuta City (67Âº29'N, 64Âº00'E), then to the Polar Urals, then southwards along the Ob River and the lower Irtysh River, then to Kurgan Province and Northern Kazakhstan (North-Kazakhstan Province, surroundings of Petropavlovsk City: 54Âº52'N, 69Âº09'E). It should be noted that the known localities of the Common Frog in West Siberia (east of Sverdlovsk and south of Tyumen provinces) are distributed quite sporadically, so the range margin is poorly known. At least some areas in the southeast of Sverdlovsk Province (adjacent to Tyumen Province) are inhabited by only one brown frog, the Moor Frog (Rana arvalis), and another brown frog, the Siberian Frog (Rana amurensis), is known eastwards. The eastern margin of the distribution of R. temporaria needs elucidation.
Rana temporaria inhabits lowland and mountain deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, through which it penetrates tundra and the forest steppes. In the forest zone, it lives in quite diverse habitats: under forest cover, in glades, bushlands, dry and swampy meadows, swamps and different kinds of anthropogenic landscape (fields, gardens, parks, settlements, cities etc.). In general, in the forest zone, it inhabits quite different landscapes from dry and open areas to overmoistened, dense fir forests. In the northern and southern parts of its range, the frog tends to occur near ponds, lakes and rivers, spending more time in water, a habit typical for this species also in the forest zone in periods of droughts. At the northern limit of its distribution, R. temporaria lives in the forest and true tundras, usually on the shores of permanent lakes. At the southern limit of its range, the frog lives in insular forests in the forest and true steppes, riverside bushlands and plavni (dense riparian vegetation in southern arid regions). In these areas, the species lives only in very moist sites, particularly near the outcrops of ground waters, and behaves as a more hygrophilous species than sympatric R. arvalis. Reproduction and early development occur in the shallow (5-50 cm) waters of lakes, ponds, swamps, ditches, river- and stream pools and puddles with stagnant or semi-flowing water. Aquatic habitats are more diverse in the centre of the species range than on its periphery.





","
In the center of the forest zone, the Common Frog is usually the most abundant amphibian. For example, in mixed forests in the centre of European Russia, abundance varies depending on habitat and activity period approximately within the range of 1-250 specimens per 1000 m2. Rana temporaria is common also in agricultural areas and even settlements and cities. In the forests of the center of European Russia, it usually prefers denser parts of forest habitats than the sympatric Moor Frog, and is rarer than the latter in the south, whereas the proportion gradually changes to the north and northwest in favor of R. temporaria. The proportion of the two species varies also by years and in some areas the dominance of one or another species alternates. Density-dependent regulation is important in overcrowded tadpole groups, where several hundred individuals per liter sometimes occur, as well as in the dense groups of recently metamorphosed froglets. However, habitat peculiarities and fluctuations in weather and climate appear to be more important in terms of the overall population dynamics. The Common Frog in the European region is probably a less thermophilous species than the sympatric Moor Frog. It frequently occurs in cooler and wetter microhabitats.
The frog usually hibernates in water: rivers, channels, ditches, springs, streams and lakes, primarily with a current. In underwater hibernacula, the Common Frog occurs in groups of many, sometimes few thousand individuals. Hibernation occurs from August - November to February - early June, depending on latitude and altitude. Reproduction occurs from March - late June, but generally in April over the main part of its distribution. Amplexus is pectoral (axillary), and it sometimes occurs on land on the way to the breeding pond.
The spawn in deposited usually in a large clump containing 670-4500 eggs. Many, sometimes hundreds and more, clumps form large aggregations. The advantages of embryonic development in large aggregations is that it minimizes temperature fluctuations and that it decreases predation potential, especially with regards to small predators, for example, invertebrates and newts, which are less successful in penetrating large aggregations than single clutches. In such masses, the temperature is a little higher than in the surrounding water. These factors lead to an increase in embryonic survival and probably accelerate development. On the other hand, the rate of embryonic development is slower and mortality is higher in the lower parts of the aggregation than in the upper parts because of hypoxia. In this respect, group spawning in shallow sites will be more advantageous than in deep sites.
Metamorphosis is completed usually in June - August. Larvae tend to concentrate into large schools in shallow water where their density sometimes reaches 100 individuals per liter. These schools may cover several hundred square meters, and the temperature there may be a little different from that in surrounding water. Crowding effect is typical for such tadpole aggregations, and the sizes of metamorphosed juveniles are variable. Larger juveniles usually metamorphosed first. They have higher survival rates during their first overwintering, which emphasize an advantage of early metamorphosis. Sexual maturity is attained no later than the 3rd year of life; the life span reaches 6 - 8 years, in the Polar Urals even 17 years.
The tadpoles consume mainly detritus, algae and higher plants. Animal food is consumed in smaller amounts. Plant and animal food diversity increase during the ontogenesis. At metamorphosis, feeding ceases for a short time after the appearance of the tadpole's forelegs. Recently metamorphosed juveniles primarily eat microarthropods: Acarina, Collembola, small larvae of Diptera. The food spectrum increases in postmetamorphic development. Adults eat mostly terrestrial prey, including Lumbricidae, Gastropoda, Aranei, Insecta etc. Aquatic prey, mainly insects and molluscs, are eaten in the largest amounts in the northern parts of the frog's distribution.
From the other hand, R. temporaria, as the another brown frog, R. arvalis, compose an important food component of many vertebrate animals. It is supposed that the dynamics of some mustelids depend on the population number and dynamics of these brown frogs. The helminth composition in R. temporaria is quite similar to that of the related frog, R. arvalis.

The species is generally neither declining, nor threatened. However, isolated peripheral populations may be vulnerable from human influences and deserve special attention or protection. Only in some areas highly transformed by people (destruction of breeding ponds and adjacent terrestrial habitats, especially during urbanization, recreation and the overpasturage of cattle) the populations are declining. In southern regions, the species is rare, but at its northern distribution in Europe it is common. However, in some West European countries (Great Britain, parts of Germany, Switzerland, etc.), the frog declines drastically due to industrial destruction and pollution of habitats (especially ponds and swamps).

Phillimore et al. (2010) suggests that projected increases in temperature for Britain (by 2050-2070) may be more than the Rana temporaria can handle, due to local adaptation. Their models predict that first spawning date for populations in southeast Britain will need to advance by about 21-39 days, but genetically influenced plasticity in spawning date may only allow an advance of 5-9 days. Gene flow northward from more southern populations already adapted to higher temperatures could help, but is unlikely due to the barriers of the English Channel and high urbanization. 





","
Although many kinds of anthropogenic influences (habitat destruction and pollution, recreation, etc.) negatively affect many populations of the Common Frog, it is a species well-adaptable to life in anthropogenic conditions. Some urban populations of this species are fairly large and safe, if suitable habitats are available. Even a high level of exploitation of the frog population for purposes of medicine and education in some sites does not destroy them. Some forms of human activity lead to an increase in the frog's number and their dispersal. For example, the construction of forest rides with numerous artificial holes filled with water. Many frogs are caught for the purposes of education, medicine and science. Along with the Marsh Frog (Rana ridibunda), the Common Frog is the main subject for such collecting. The amount of these two frog species caught in the 1970s - 1980s in the former USSR measured by several tons annually. However, no population declines resulted from this.

The pathogenic amphibian fungus known as Bsal (Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) may be the most potent amphibian disease and poses extreme risk to natural populations, especially in salamanders. First detected in Fire Salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in extreme southeastern Netherlands and adjacent Belgium and reported in 2013, it has spread to western Germany (with new reports from Bavaria), where it is having devastating effects. An entire issue of the journal Salamandra (2020, vol 56, issue 3, open access and available as PDF) is devoted to Bsal research centered in Germany. Salamander populations have essentially disappeared from the northern Eiffel region and are threatened in the southern Eiffel and Ruhr regions. Bsal has been present in Germany for at least 16 years and has been found in laboratory populations of the Common Frog, Rana temporaria, and field populations of the Great Crested Newt, Triturus cristatus. It is known to infect salamandrid species from southeast Asia, which appear to have been the source of the European outbreaks via pet trade importation. The goal in highlighting this important set of papers as stated by the editors ""must go beyond documenting declines towards understanding spatio-temporal disease dynamics and the factors influencing the spread and impact of Bsal in different situations."" In light of the seriousness of the Bsal threat in Germany, the authors' common goal is a national Bsal Action Plan, which would be of great importance for the international community of amphibian biologists and for the public (Written by David B. Wake).

Amphibians of high elevation mountain lakes face many threats: climate change, novel pathogens, development, and overexploitation; however, the presence of non-native fish is the most significant. A study in the Pyrenees (MirÃ³ et al 2020) found rapid natural recovery of amphibian communities when non-native fish were removed from eight study lakes and compared them to 56 nearby control lakes with and without fish. The fish-removal lakes achieved natural richness levels one year after fish removal began, and typical species abundances after three years (with the only exception of Rana temporaria). Colonization of removal lakes occurred only from residual populations in the same valley. This study provides another example that montane amphibian communities can recover rapidly after eliminating or reducing non-native fish, and bolsters this technique to help other endangered amphibians in similar habitats (Written by Vance Vredenberg).

How will increasing temperatures from the climate crisis impact amphibian aging and mortality? Despite its relevance to conservation, little data exists on the relationship between temperature and senescence in free-living animals. Cayuela et al. (2021) studied pairs of frogs from two families divided by 100 million years of evolutionary history to answer this: Rana luteiventris and R. temporaria (Ranidae) and Anaxyrus boreas and Bufo bufo (Bufonidae). The North American toads (Bufonidae) represented sampling along a climatic gradient, whereas the ranid frogs represented sampling from climatically contrasted sites. They found that actuarial senescence ratesâ€” i.e., the rate at which mortality increases with ageâ€” increased with the mean annual temperature experienced in all species. In all species but Anaxyrus boreas, increasing temperatures corresponded to decreasing lifespans. These relationships are presumably attributed to amphibians' increasing pace of life with increasing temperatures; they are active for longer periods, have a higher metabolism, lower mitochondrial efficiency, and accumulate oxidative damage more rapidly. The impacts of increasing temperature on these frogs might be exacerbated by increasing evaporative water loss and influenced by genes involved in adapting amphibians to warmer conditions. In the ranids studied, the authors found increasing temperatures flipped sex differences in senescence rate in R. luteiventris but not R. temporaria. These results paint a grim picture for amphibians as global temperatures increase. Amphibian aging is expected to accelerate, with potential skewing sex ratios in some species.

Habitat loss or modification is the biggest threat to amphibians, which includes the introduction of non-native plants. Eucalyptus globulus trees have been introduced globally from its native Australia, and its negative effects on native species, including adult amphibians, have been documented. What about other stages? Iglesias-Carrasco et al. (2022) investigated with experiments on the effects of eucalypt leachates on tadpole behavior, morphology, growth, and immune response. Rana temporaria, Alytes obstetricans, and Pelophylax perezi tadpoles were raised in mesocosms with either native oak or exotic eucalypt leachates then exposed to predator cues. The authors found that while anti-predator responses were not significantly affected, tadpoles raised in eucalypt leachates were smaller and had weaker immune responses. Furthermore, the morphology of P. perezi tadpoles in eucalypt treatments were similar to the stress morphology of other species, which may affect the tadpolesâ€™ ability to escape predators and jump in later development. Although species varied in responses, these results indicate that the poor nutrient content and high toxicity of Eucalyptus have strong impacts at critical early stages of frog development. Further studies are needed to fully understand the long-term fitness consequences of Eucalyptus monocultures. (Written by Ann Chang)

Rana tsushimensis is slender bodied frog. The snout-vent length range of males is range 31 - 37 mm and of females is 37 - 44 mm.   The canthus is blunt and concave.  The tympanum is circular, and there are 2 - 6 vomerine teeth which are oval.  There is moderate webbing, where the broad webbing leaves 1 - 2 phalanges in males and 2 - 3 in females free on the outer margin of 4th toe. The inner metatarsal tubercle is elliptical, and the outer one is small but distinct. The skin on the back of the frog is covered with small granules which have asperities on them.  The dorsolateral fold is evident, slightly flaring outwards above tympanum, and the supratympanic fold is blunt. There is no vocal sac or vocal opening and the nuptial pads in males (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

The nupitial pads are grayish brown (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

This species breeds from January to April in still waters in rice fields, ponds, ditches and pools.  It is often sympatric with R. dybowskii.  However, different calls seem to prevent hybridization.  Females lay approximately 400 - 500 eggs each. The eggs have a diameter of 1.7 - 2.3 mm (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

Mating call duration is 1 sec with 3 - 5 notes.  Dominating frequency 2.1 kHz, with marked frequency modulation and clear harmonics (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

Rana tsushimensis is sometimes regarded as a subspecies of R. amurensis, but it isn't, because artificially produced hybrid embryos between R. tsushimensis and R. a. coreana are not viable.  The species is closely related to R. okinavana, and these probably bridge R. japonica and R. tagoi (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

The species usually lives on the ground or on rocks, and is seldomly found in trees (Maeda & Matsui 1990).  


","
Buergeria japonica has limited breeding sites. Tadpoles on this island were found in hot springs, and a study (Komaki et al. 2016) reports on the thermal tolerance of the species. The highest temperature of a pool occupied by tadpoles was 46.1 Â°C. Experiments show that this is very close to the critical thermal maximum of the species. Other frogs are known to inhabit hot springs but this is the highest temperature recorded in nature.

Many species of frogs and toads call in large choruses. However, communication can be difficult when multiple individuals are calling at the same time, like humans trying to hold a conversation at a crowded party. When multiple male frogs are calling at the same time, female attraction to individual calls is often reduced. Despite this cost, males of some species deliberately overlap their mating calls, â€œsynchronizingâ€ their signals. Legett et al. (2021) examined the potential functions of synchronized mating calls in a Japanese treefrog, the Ryukyu Kajika Frog (Buergeria japonica). They found that call synchronization may benefit male Ryukyu Kajika frogs in two ways. One, synchronized calls are louder than non-synchronized calls, attracting females to the chorus from a greater distance. Two, synchronized calls reduce the attraction of predators and parasites, such as frog-biting mosquitoes. Interestingly, female Ryukyu Kajika frogs attraction to individual calls was not affected by synchronization, suggesting that relaxed sexual selection may be key to the evolution of synchronized signaling strategies.

1. DESCRIPTION:: 
Chiromantis doriae is a small, arboreal frog that has an average snout-vent length of 25 - 27 mm in males and 29 - 34 mm in females (AmphibiaChina 2022).  The length of the head is slightly larger than the width of the head. The snout is pointed and the canthus rostralis is obtuse (Muansanga et al. 2021) and distinct (Riyanto and Kurniati 2014). The eyes protrude from the head and the pupils are horizontal (Muansanga et al. 2021). The distance between the eyes is slightly larger than the distance between the nostrils (AmphibiaChina 2022). The tympanum is distinct, round, and slightly concave. The tympanum is about half the diameter of the eye, and is slightly larger than the suction cup on the third finger. The tympanum sits closely to the eye (Riyanto and Kurniati 2014, Muansanga et al. 2021, AmphibiaChina 2022). The skin of the dorsum is smooth (Riyanto and Kurniati. 2014). The abdomen and the ventral surface of both thighs are covered in small, flat warts. The fore- and hind limbs are slim. The forearm and hand are slightly less than half the length of the body. The fingers on the hands are wide and flat. The fingers have discs and marginal grooves. The discs on the first and second finger are smaller than those on the third and fourth finger. The relative finger lengths are 3 > 4 > 2 > 1 (Muansanga et al. 2021).  The fingers and toes are webbed. Webbing between the first and second finger is less developed than the webbing between the second, third, and fourth fingers (AmphibiaChina 2022). The length of the shin os slightly greater than, or equal to, half the length of the body. The toes have discs as well, but they are slightly smaller than those present on the fingers. The relative toe lengths are 4 > 5 > 3 > 2 > 1 (Muansanga et al. 2021). 

DIAGNOSIS:
A notable trait of Chiromantis doriae are the longitudinal stripes on its dorsum, which differentiates it from C. nongkhorensis that has no stripes or blotchy pattern. Another trait is that C. doriae has is multiple pulses per call whereas the species C. hansenae only has a single pulse per call (Aowphol et al. 2013).  

COLORATION:: 
Body color can range from a bright yellow to brown (AmphibiaChina 2022). The body has five longitudinal stripes that are brown or dark brown on the dorsum along with the presence of a dark postorbital stripe (Riyanto and Kurniati. 2014). The stripes can appear continuous or irregular. The back of the limbs are a light purple and can have black horizontal stripes. The base of the hind legs and the ventral surface of the throat can range from light yellow to white. The lower lip can have small dark spots. The ventral surface of the hind legs is red (AmphibiaChina 2022).  

VARIATION:
Males have a small nuptial pad on the first finger. Males also tend to have more vibrant coloration (AmphibiaChina 2022).
","
Chiromantis doriae has been found in northeastern Bangladesh, southwestern Cambodia, China, northeastern India, Laos, Myanmar, central and western Thailand, and Vietnam (Frost 2020). They can be found at elevations of 80 - 1650 m above sea level (AmphibiaChina 2022). 

","
The breeding season of C. doriae is May through August and most individuals spawn after rainfall (AmphibiaChina 2022, Yang et al. 2019). Breeding occurs within small ponds where females will build foam-nests for the eggs above water level on natural structures such as vegetation (Aowphol et al. 2013). Females lay around 180 eggs in a clutch and this species can breed up to two times per year (AmphibiaChina 2022). 

Chiromantis doriae has a call that has an average length of 215.47 ms. It has multiple pulses per call, on average 3 - 6 pulses per call. The frequency at which these calls occur are 4.0 - 4.5 kHz on average (Aowphol et al. 2013). The call on average contains around six discrete notes, but can range from two to fourteen notes per call (Yang et al. 2019).
","
The tadpole body is flat. The tail length of the tadpole is about 170% the length of the snout-vent length. The tail has a sharp tip (AmphibiaChina 2022). 

There is a stripe that runs from the snout, to the eye, to the side of the body in tadpoles. The first half of the tail is lightly colored with fine stripes and the second half of the tail is black with no patterning (AmphibiaChina 2022). 

","
Chiromantis doriae is listed as â€œLeast Concernâ€ by the IUCN red list. However, the population trends of this species is unknown and its habitat is considered threatened due to quality declines from local agriculture, pollution, logging, and fire. However, this species occurs in multiple protected areas within its range, including Daweishan, Huangliangshan, and Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserves in China, Namdhapa National Park in India, and Phou Louey National Biodiversity Conservation Area in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Chou 2004).
","

","
PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS::
Chiromantis doriae presents an interesting phylogenetic case, as C. doriae was originally referred to as Chirixalus doriae. Today these names are used synonymous with each other (Frost et al. 2006). 

In 2006, Frost et al. combined previous anatomical evidence with DNA sequences from mitochondrial transcription unit H1, which includes 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA genes, and several nuclear genes including histone H3, tyrosinase, ribosomal subunit 28S, and rhodopsin. The study used parsimony analysis under direct optimization to conclude the positioning of C. doriae. This resulted in a paraphyly between Chirixalus doriae and the species that was then known as Chirixalus vittatus (now Feihyla vittatus) with respect to the Chiromantis group. The name change from Chirixalus doriae to Chiromantis doriae was done in order to correct the paraphyletic nature of the Chirixalus group (Frost et al. 2006). A later Bayesian study of combined 12S and 16S mtDNA and t-RNA for Valine nDNA found that C. doriae is sister to the clade composed of C. rufensens and C. xerampelina (Li et al. 2009). 

ETYMOLOGY (Origin or explanation of scientific name): 
The species epithet, â€œdoriaeâ€ is in reference to Giacomo Doria, an Italian zoologist (Beolens et al. 2013).

Kurixalus eiffingeri is a small and robust frog.  The forelimb and hindlimb webbing is not well developed. The skin on the back of this species has tubercles and ridges.  This species has 3-6 vomerine teeth.  The mean snout to vent length for males is 34 mm (range 31-35) and for females it is 37 mm (range 36-40).  In males, the nuptial pads are yellow and are without asperities.  There is a pair of slit-like vocal openings.  The species also has no dorsolateral fold, but the supratympanic fold is prominent (Maeda and Matsui 1990).



","
This species is found in both Taiwan and Japan, specifically on Ishigakijima and Iriomotejima Islands in Japan.  The natural habitat is mountainous forests, especially of bamboo (Maeda and Matsui 1990).



","
Males of the Eiffinger's Tree Frog call from bamboo stumps filled with rain water (phytotelmata) to attract females during the breeding season (February to August). The females lay eggs above the waterline on the walls of the tree holes or stumps to be fertilized. Male frogs may guard egg sites for up to 2 weeks (ca. 10-14 days) until they hatch. Tadpoles, when hatched, will drop into the water body where they grow and develop (Lin and Kam 2008).

Selection of egg deposition sites are governed by water depths among other factors but clearly males are selective, especially given the amount of parental care required of both males and females (Lin and Kam 2008).
","
Tadpoles are obligate oophages, fed by female frogs which lay unfertilized eggs into the water for the tadpoles to eat (Lin and Kam 2008).
","

","

The mating call has notes that last 0.8 seconds with a frequency of 2.7 kHz (Maeda and Matsui 1990).

Polypedates leucomystax is a small to medium-sized common tree frog, with males averaging 50 mm in total length and females averaging 80 mm in total length (McKay 2006). P. leucomystax ground color is a variable shade of brown, ranging from pale brown to yellow-brown, reddish brown, gray-brown, or dark brown  
(McKay 2006).  Throughout most of its range, patterning is prevalent, and the pattern varies from spotted to longitudinally striped.  Plain forms are also seen but not as commonly. 
(Frith 1977; McKay 2006). However, on Bali, the most common form is plain, without pattern.  
(McKay 2006).   
","
Polypedates leucomystax is widely distributed throughout South and Southeast Asia.  It thrives in both wetlands and forests. In urban settings, P. leucomystax can be found in garden ponds, on buildings, and on roads (Frith, 1977)[3663]. 
","
Breeding is year-round in some parts of the range such as north Borneo and the wetter parts of Bali. However, in drier areas such as north Bali, breeding is restricted to the start of the wet season. Males congregate at still or slow-moving water, or puddles, and call from the edges or elevated positions on vegetation. The call has been described as a ""widely spaced nasal quack, and occasionally a low throaty chuckle"" (McKay 2006). 

Polypedates leucomystax females deposit from 100-400 eggs in oval-shaped foam nests (Yorke 1983).  The foam nests measure about 10 cm in length and are constructed on vegetation above ephemeral pools  (Yorke 1983), or attached to a surface by the water's edge (McKay 2006).  Hatching takes place after three to four days, occurring at the external gill stage (Yorke 1983; McKay 2006).  At this point the larvae wriggle free of the foam nest and drop into the water below (McKay 2006). 
","
Tadpoles are opportunistic predators, attacking and consuming nearly anything they can, including both live and dead conspecific tadpoles and decaying vegetation. From hatching to metamorphosis takes approximately seven weeks (Yorke 1983). 
","
It is currently not threatened, due to its tolerance for various environmental conditions, and is abundant throughout its range (Frith, 1977)[3663].

Rhacophorus reinwardtii is a medium to large-sized tree frog with a broad head (Inger and Stuebing 2005). Females have a snout-vent length of 55.4-79.6 mm, while males range from 41.6-52.5 mm (Ohler and Delorme 2006). The dorsal skin is smooth (Ohler and Delorme 2006) or granular (Inger and Stuebing 2005).  There is a wide flap of skin on the outer edge of the forearm (Inger and Stuebing 2005). It has complete webbing of the hands and feet (Ohler and Delorme 2006). The heel has a wide, rounded flap and continues as a narrow fringe along the lower leg (Inger and Stuebing 2005).  Sexual dimorphism is present, but is not as distinct in females (Ohler and Delorme 2006). 

 In the adult frog, coloration of the dorsal surface is a dark green with dark spots, fading into a golden yellow on the flank.  The side also has a black band with turquoise blue spots.  Webbing is black with golden yellow and bright blue spots.  The underside of the frog is pure white (Inger and Stuebing 2005).  


","
This species can be found in Java (Schlegel 1837; Iskandar 1998) and Sumatra, Indonesia; Sarawak and Sabah, Borneo (Inger and Stuebing 2005), on Peninsular Malaysia (Grandison 1972; Berry 1975; Dring 1979), and in southern Thailand (Taylor 1962; Chan-ard 2003). It has not been recorded from Brunei or Kalimantan (Indonesia), but it is thought likely to occur there also (Stuart et al. 2008). It occurs mainly at low elevations in primary rainforests (Inger and Stuebing 2005), but has been recorded up to 1,400 m asl (Stuart et al. 2008).  
","
This is a canopy-dwelling species, but descends to the forest floor for breeding in semi-permanent pools (Inger and Stuebing 2005).  
It is an explosive breeder. Rhacophorus reinwardtii constructs foam nests above breeding ponds in the forest (Stuart et al. 2008).     

The call has been described as sounding like a low crackling chuckle (Inger and Stuebing 2005). 

It is speculated that the adults most likely feed on canopy insects (Inger and Stuebing 2005).
","
The tadpole morphology is typical of its genus; a large, oval and slightly flattened body that has a total length up to 60 mm. The leaf-shaped tail is less than 2x the body length. The tadpole coloration is gray-brown with scattered black spots (Inger and Stuebing 2005).
","
 Rhacophorus reinwardtii  has a decreasing population trend (Stuart et al 2008).  It is considered to be rare, but as a canopy species it is difficult to observe (Stuart et al. 2008). However, it is suggested that it might be locally abundant because of adults that are observed to congregate in the dozens at pools for breeding (Ohler et al. 2006). Reports from Borneo are rare (Inger and Stuebing 2005).
 It is dependent on relatively undisturbed mature lowland rainforest (Stuart et al. 2008). Significant loss of rain forest habitat due to logging, agricultural expansion and human settlements is the main threat to  Rhacophorus reinwardtii (Ohler and Delorme 2006).  This species is also threatened by water pollution, smaller-holder and agro-industry farming (Ohler and Delorme 2006).  It apparently does not occur within any adequately protected areas (Stuart et al. 2008). 
","

","
The species  authority is recorded by Frost in Amphibian Species of the World (http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/index) as Schlegel (1840), but Inger and Tan (1996) record it as Schlegel (1837).
 Specimens from Viet Nam are now considered to belong to Rhacophorus kio (Ohler et al. 2006).

These moderately large burrowing frogs have a very unique morphology.  Their body is flaccid and covered with loose skin.  Their snout is shortened both laterally and ventrally and both the snout and vent are covered with sensory tubercles.  The head is very tiny and pointed and the eyes are also very small.  They have no neck and no visible tympanum.  They have short, robust limbs, and their front digits have only a trace of webbing, while the four back digits are short and extensively webbed.  They also have two enlarged spades on the inner surface of the metatarsus (ankle). Coloration patterns show scattered loose spots and blotches ranging in color from yellow to reddish orange in varying degrees of shading, the dorsal color is dark brown or nearly black.  The males have paired internal vocal sacs.  The females tend to be substantially larger than the males in this species (description from Lee 1996). 
 
The tadpoles of Rhynophrynus dorsalis show distinct characteristics.  The dorsum of the tadpoles is generally dark gray to black while the venter is iridescent silver. At night, the head and body are often translucent, and Lee,(1996)  
suggests that the pigmentation may exhibit a diel cycle. The head is flat and broad with small laterally placed eyes and a slit for a mouth, which is surrounded by delicate barbles.  The tail is usually about 1.5 times the length of the body and the dorsal fin extends onto the posterior third of the body. Both the dorsal and ventral fins are of about the same depth (description from Lee 1996).  
 
 
 

","
This species occurs at low elevations on the Atlantic slope, from southern Texas to Guatemala, and on the Pacific slope, from Guerrero to Costa Rico.  They are generally found on savannas and seasonally dry forest (Lee 1996).  
 
 

","
These terrestrial frogs construct subterranean burrows to make it through the dry seasons without suffering from desiccation. They burrow backwards into the soil, using the enlarged spades on the back of their heels.  Their above ground activity is limited to the rainy season when they feed on termites, ants and other insects.  The beginning of the rainy season marks the mating season, and males are usually found in large choruses in temporary bodies of water.  The female, after inguinal amplexus will release several thousand eggs, either individually or in small groups, into the water.  The eggs will sink to the bottom and hatch within a few days (descriptions from Lee 1996). 
 
 

","

","

","

","
Rhynophrynus dorsalis has a very unique call, in fact as Lee (1996) 
 brings to our attention, the Mayan name for the species, uo, is an onomatopeic rendering of the call.  The call has been described as ""a loud, protracted, ascending whoop, or uooooooooo, it is also described as being well modulated with a distinct harmonic structure"" (Lee 1996)..   
The sound is loud and travels great distances. Etymology:  Rhinophrynus is from the Greek rhinos, meaning nose and phrynus, meaning toad. dorsalis, comes from Latin, meaning ""pertaining to the back"" (Lee 1996). 
 
Although commonly referred to as 'toads', Rhynophrynus is not related to the family Bufonidae; this species is the only extant representative of the family Rhynophrynidae (e.g. Ford and Cannatella 1992)

Usually greenish, greenish-yellow, or brownish yellow with blotches of  
dark spots. Like all members of the family Pelobatidae, S. couchii has 
 a black, keratinized spade on its hind feet. This species can be distinguished by its  
sickle-shaped spade (Stebbins 1985) 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Occurs from southwest Oklahoma, central New Mexico, and south-central Arizona to 
the tip of Baja California, Nayarit and south San Luis Potosi; southeast  
California to central Texas. Some isolated populations are in the vicinity of  
Petrified Forest National Monument and southeast of La Junta, Otero Co.,  
Colorado. Also, some scattered populations in California between Amos and  
Ogilby on eastern side of Algodones Dunes; Purgatory and Buzzardâ€™s Peak Washes, 
 Imperial Co.  Scaphiopus couchii is often found in shortgrass plains,  
mesquite savannah, creosote bush desert, thornforest and tropical deciduous  
forest (west Mexico) and other areas of low rainfall. Information from Stebbins (1985) 
 
 
 
 
 
 

","
Scaphiopus couchii burrow backwards into the ground to avoid the heat and desiccation common to 
 desert habitats. Toadlets can often remain active longer than adults which hibernate  
for 9-10 months out of the year about 1 m below the surface. Adults emerge after  
annual rains arrive, usually in May, and stay active until September. They  
breed in ephemeral ponds and feed during this terrestrial period, usually on  
desert invertebrates for no more than 20 nights. It is not uncommon for  
this species to exhibit phenotypic plasticity for age at metamorphosis and even 
 cannibalistic morphs.

The Plains Spadefoot Toad or Central Plains Spadefoot is a small, rotund, toad-like frog, generally resembling true toads (Bufonidae) in body form.  Spea bombifrons can grow up to 2Â¼ inches in snout-vent length (Colorado Herpetological Society 2002). Its skin, which is relatively smooth, can range from gray to brown, sometimes with a greenish hue, and is scattered with darker spots or blotches.  The skin is smoother and thinner than that of Bufonidae species.  Along the dorsal and lateral surfaces run four vague light stripes, the middle two of which occasionally resemble an hourglass.  There are many small tubercles on the otherwise smooth skin.  The ventral surface is white and has no markings, although the throat of the male is bluish or grayish on the sides (USGS 2002).
  
There is a raised, bony lump (boss) between the large eyes.  The eye has an elliptical, vertical, cat-like pupil, and thus differs from the true toads, whose pupils are round.  S. bombifrons also differs from Bufo in that it has no parotid glands (or, when present, they are indistinct) (USGS 2002). 

Like the other members of the family Pelobatidae, or the spadefoots, S. bombifrons is named for its large, well-developed, wedge-shaped, sharp-edged, black tubercle or metatarsal ""spade"" on the bottom of each hind foot.  This bony element, which is capped with a keratinous cover, is used to burrow rear-first (USGS 2002).


","
Spea bombifrons is native to the more arid Plains region of western North America: the plains east of the Rocky Mountains from southern Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan to northwest Texas and Chihuahua, Mexico, east to Missouri and eastern Oklahoma and into eastern Arizona, with isolated populations in south Texas and Mexico (Stebbins 1985). 

Throughout the majority of its range, the distribution S. bombifrons is highly correlated with sandy, gravelly, or sandy loam soils, but it ranges from deserts in the American Southwest to aspen parkland in the Canadian prairies
(Bragg 1944; Cook 1960; Black 1970; Huggins 1971; Femmer 1978; Collins 1982; Cook and Hatch 1964; Cottonwood Consultants 1986). 

S. bombifrons has been found in unvegetated sand dunes, sand dunes with willow and cottonwood, upland prairie, desert, short and mixedgrass prairie, mixed shrubland, fescue grassland, floodplains, and sagebrush (Bragg 1944; Black 1970; Huggins 1971; Stebbins 1985; Axys 1996 and 1997).  

East of the Rockies, S. bombifrons is found in shortgrass prairie and desert grasslands, where the soil is loose (USGS 2002).



","
The habitat, breeding season, and breeding location are highly related. S. bombifrons is nocturnal, and spends most of its time underground, emerging only to breed in favorable moist conditions, or to feed (Lauzon 1999). 
 During extended droughts, the frog does not remain underground indefinitely but emerges, especially during humid weather, to forage during the evening (Bragg 1965; Ruibal 1969).
 S. bombifrons burrows deeper into the soil and emerges less frequently as the summer progresses and the soil dries (Bragg 1965). 
 It prefers loose soil, where it can easily burrow with the aid of its â€œspadesâ€ up to depths of almost 1 m (Baxter & Stone 1980; Russell & Bauer 1993; USGS 2002).  
They will most often burrow along the edge of a solid object or near a plant that provides security or shade (Bragg 1944).  
During the winter, it burrows deeply to avoid freezing and desiccation, as S. bombifrons does not tolerate freezing and must burrow below the frost line (Baxter & Stone 1980). 
 This spadefoot toad surfaces quickly from its burrow and opportunistically migrates to breeding wetlands during periods of heavy rainfall and warm temperatures (Bragg 1965; Klassen 1998; Lauzon & Balagus 1998). 
 The measured amount of rainfall required for emergence varies from 2.5 to 10.4 cm (Black 1970; Femmer 1978; Farrar & Hey 1995). 

Large choruses of these frogs have been associated with heavy rainfall, but the temporary wetlands that result from light rain or snow melt are known to attract small choruses as well (Lauzon 1999).  S. bombifrons has been observed calling when daily maximum temperatures were 12.5Â°C to 23.5Â° and daily minimum temperatures were 7Â°C to 10.5Â°C (Klassen 1998), although breeding frogs have been observed in the southeastern extreme of their range at temperatures as low as 9Â°C (Bragg 1965).  S. bombifrons has been observed calling at water temperatures of 10.5Â°C to 16Â°C (Lauzon 1999). 

No studies so far have been conducted on the home range of S. bombifrons, but the related Eastern Spadefoot (Spea holbrooki holbrooki) has an average home range of 10.1 m2, with male home ranges generally larger than those of the female (Pearson 1955). 
S. bombifrons is known to be capable of migrating at least 1.6 km to breeding sites, and juveniles have been found more than 2 km from known breeding wetlands within weeks of metamorphosis (Landreth & Christensen 1971; Klassen 1998). This frog forages above ground, and preys on a variety of insects (Lauzon 1999). In Oklahoma, this included flies, hymenopterans, moths, beetles, pentatomids, and various spiders (Bragg 1944). 

S. bombifrons is generally active from the start of its breeding season until the fall (Lauzon 1999). The breeding season is generally correlated with annual peaks in precipitation.  In the center of its range, S. bombifrons breeds from May to August.  In the southern end of its range, S. bombifrons breeds in July, after the summer rains.  In the northern part, breeding may take place in late May at the earliest.  If appropriate environmental conditions do not occur during the active season, breeding may not occur at all; conversely, S. bombifrons may breed more than once in a single year if conditions are particularly conducive (Bragg 1944 & 1965; Klassen 1998). 

Spea bombifrons lays its eggs in a variety of wetlands, but prefers flooded areas and temporary pools (USGS 2002). Its preference for sandy soils leaves S. bombifrons with limited breeding opportunities, since the soil drains rapidly and precludes the development of breeding wetlands.  As a result, this spadefoot relies on fine-textured, less permeable soils within sandier habitats where temporary wetlands form and it is able to breed (Lauzon 1999).  
Breeding pond depths vary from 10 cm to more than 1 m.  It tolerates varying amounts of vegetation, and native as well as introduced habitats (Bragg 1965; Farrar & Hey 1995; Klassen 1998).  
Spawning S. bombifrons have been observed in partially flooded fields, roadside ditches, flooded dugouts, shallow temporary wetlands in fallow fields, temporary ponds in uplands, along streams, semi-permanent pools, oxbow lakes, stream meander channels, unvegetated sloughs, marshy depressions, flooded cultivated fields, temporary wetlands in pastures, river backwaters, and ditches (Cook 1965; Cottonwood 1986; Preston & Hatch 1986). These frogs have been observed breeding in non-native habitats such as a construction site (Femmer 1978), flooded soybean fields and cornfields (Farrar & Hey 1995), a flooded wheat field, and even driveways and bicycle paths (Didiuk). 

This spadefoot breeds quickly to take advantage of its typically ephemeral wetland, and to allow the eggs and larvae as much time as possible to develop.  The largest numbers have been observed during or the first night after heavy rains, with counts falling off dramatically thereafter (Bragg 1965).  

Generally, males migrate to the breeding wetlands before females, and generally outnumber them in a given time and place (Bragg 1945; Baxter & Stone 1980). The call of the male is loud, harsh, and may be heard at distances of up to 3 km (Lauzon 1999).  The male spadefoot call greatly stimulates both sexes, and larger choruses attract more individuals of both sexes (Bragg 1945).  
Females lay up to 2,000 eggs in clutches of 10 to 250 each (Bragg 1965; Collins 1982). Whereas true toads lay their eggs in strings, S. bombifrons females lay eggs in spherical masses, attached to submerged vegetation (Baxter & Stone 1980).  Suspended soil particles and other debris adhere to the sticky surface of the egg mass to help camouflage them from predators (Bragg 1965).  

The rate of egg development is temperature dependent, and under normal conditions spadefoot eggs will hatch in about two days (Bragg 1965). The lethal temperature limits for eggs are 34Â°C (Justus 1977). Spadefoot toads (family Pelobatidae) as a group have the fastest development rate among amphibians (Bragg 1961). 
Larval development is also temperature dependent and thus allows the tadpoles to develop faster in conditions that evaporate the temporary breeding wetlands (Buchholz & Hayes 1996).  In southern regions (in this study, Oklahoma), the time from hatching to metamorphosis may be as little as 14 days (Bragg 1967), with a range of 17 to 20 (in Missouri) days being more common (Femmer 1978); in the north (Alberta), metamorphosis has been observed 21 to 34 days after hatching, with some tadpoles requiring 60 days (Klassen 1998).




","
The tadpoles of the plains spadefoot can occur in two ecomorphotypes-- carnivorous and omnivorous forms. 
The carnivorous tadpoles have longer snouts, larger serrated beaks with an upper cusp and lower notch, shorter and less coiled intestines than the omnivorous form. These forms were discovered in the Missouri River flood plain, western Iowa, where tadpoles were found in flooded soybean and corn fields (Farrar and Hay 1997). 

This is similar to the tadpole morphotypes of its relative Spea multiplicata, which also displays a carnivorous amd omnivorous tadpole forms (Farrar and Hay 1997). Hence developmental plasticity in  has been well studied (e.g, Ledon-Rettig et al 2008).
","
This amphibian is not included on any list of rare, endangered, threatened, or sensitive species (Nature Conservancy 1999; RedList). The Nature Conservancy assigns S. bombifrons a global rank of G5, indicating that the species is â€œdemonstrably secureâ€ across its global range (Nature Conservancy 1999). The IUCN Redlist ranks this species as Least Concern.

Substantial population declines observed during extended droughts are more likely a result of non-breeding during suboptimal environmental conditions than true population declines (Cottonwood 1986).

The Province of Alberta places S. bombifrons on its Blue List of species that may be at risk of declining to non-viable levels within the Provinceâ€™s boundaries (Alberta Wildlife Management Division 1996).  In Canada, this speciesâ€™ highly variable population size, the result of annual variability in the availability of breeding wetlands, do not provide evidence to suggest that the range is contracting (Lauzon 1999). The population in Alberta, Canada is considered stable but moderately threatened due to current land use practices (Lauzon 1999).




","
Alteration and destruction of habitat are considered the possible risk to habitats suitable for S. bombifrons.  Availability of wintering and breeding habitats are the likely limiting factors of this amphibian; agriculture is primarily responsible for the loss of prairie land and is probably the most significant threat (Lauzon 1999). Cultivation and drainage of wetlands, as for cattle, as well as flood control, have also been identified as potential threats (Cottonwood 1986). 

 The extent to which fragmentation of prairie land and other habitats has affected toad movements between populations or the re-colonization of populations sinks is unknown (Didiuk 1997). 
 Other human activities, such as the widespread use of herbicides and pesticides, oil and gas exploration and development, and road kills have been implicated in the decline of related amphibians and those with similar ranges as S. bombifrons, but none has been studied specifically with regard to this species (Lauzon 1999).

Depending on environmental conditions, tadpoles of the Spea genus can switch from omnivores to predaceous carnivores that display cannibalism similar to post-metamorphic feeding behavior. The switch has long been attributed to heterochrony, or the developmental shift in the timing of gene-expression. However, LedÃ³n-Rettig (2021) tested this hypothesis against an alternative that a novel pattern of gene expression is behind the ecological behavioral shift. She quantified RNA expression in two morphotypes of Spea bombifrons at two points in their development, tadpole and juvenile, and found that gene expression of tadpoles were more similar to each other than the gene expression of juveniles, which were also more similar to each other than to tadpoles. However, predaceous tadpoles also expressed a different suite of genes than omnivorous tadpoles lending support to the alternative hypothesis of a novel pattern of gene expression. These findings do not discount a role for heterochrony, but provide evidence of the potential for multiple routes to novel behaviors. (Written by Ann Chang)

Spea hammondii, the Western Spadefoot Toad, is medium-sized with adults reaching up to 65 mm in SVL.  The skin is loose with small vertebral tubercles.  The head is as wide as the body, having a rounded snout with an upward tilt and large protuberant eyes.  The parotoid glands are small and not distinct. Forelimbs and hindlimbs are short and stout, with the foreleg having dorsal tubercles.  The feet have well-developed webbing between the toes. The main distinguishing features are the single semicircular black ""spade"" (keratinized inner metatarsal tubercle) on each heel, and vertical pupils.  
 
The dorsal ground color ranges from light green to gray with scattered darker splotches.  A pair of light-colored spots is generally present, one on each side of the anus. Body tubercles can be orange to somewhat red. Usually a pair of light-colored paravertebral stripes is present, extending from behind the eyes. Ventrally, the color is whitish to creamy-yellow.

Western spadefoot toads occur throughout the Central Valley of California into northwestern Baja California. In Baja California, they are found at least as far south as Mesa de San Carlos.  They inhabit sandy areas or regions with loose soil, primarily in arroyos, fields, and open plains.
","
Outside of the mating season, Spea hammondii spend most of their time underground in their burrows. The Western spadefoots are mostly nocturnal creatures, but can be heard calling during the day following winter and spring rain. 
Mating occurs from late December to mid-May. Spadefoot toads are ""explosive"" breeders, taking rapid advantage of summer rains and ensuing temporary ponds to mate.  Their mating call consists of a loud snore lasting 0.5 to 1 second, sounding like w-a-a-a or r-a-a-a-w.   

A single female can lay more than 600 eggs, attaching them to vegetation.  
Development can be extraordinarily rapid, with hatching occurring in as little as five days. Tadpoles are light gray to dark greenish brown in color, with a cream-colored underside and a transparent tail. The larvae have a fast growth rate and can be distinguished by their tendency to hang vertically in the water and gulp air or feed on surface material.  Larvae are carnivorous and have been observed preying on other species' tadpoles as well as on conspecific tadpoles. The adult diet consists mostly of arthropods.

 Habitat loss and degradation are the greatest causes of amphibian declines globally. A commonly proposed solution is to create artificial habitat â€“ such as ""mitigation"" ponds - which can act as substitute habitat for amphibians displaced by habitat loss. But how well do they work? Baumberger et al. (2020) tested longterm success of created habitat by resurveying 21 mitigation ponds ten years post-construction and ten natural ponds impacted by urban development in southern California. They found that the artificial ponds maintained the adequate hydroperiod to sustain Western Spadefoot Toads (Spea hammondii), the species these ponds were targetting. Critically, western spadefoot larvae and embryos had been translocated to these ponds a decade earlier and many ponds still host populations which not only successfully breed but also metamorphose. These artificial habitats serve an important role because surveys found these toads are now entirely absent in the urban landscape they used to exist in. Given Western Spadefoot Toads are an IUCN Near-Threatened species, a California Species of Special Concern, and are under review for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, knowing that created habitat is a successful conservation tool is critical for their conservation. Importantly, southern California is experiencing tremendous effects of climate change and these ponds were impacted by drought but provided western spadefoots a buffer against the effects of climate change. If designed correctly, artificial habitat can be a useful tool to buffer amphibian declines from both habitat loss and climate change (Written by Max Lambert).

A small toad of the family Pelobatidae, the genus is characteristically 
short-legged and squat, having vertical ""cat-eye"" pupils, and a black, 
keratinized spade (used for burrowing) on the underside of each hind foot.
Their skin is relatively smooth compared to the rough, warty epidermis of true
toads (genus Bufo).  Females are slighty larger than males.  
Distinguishing features include a slightly upturned, ""pug-nose"", a raised 
callus, or boss, between the eyes, and a dark brown or orange spot on each 
upper eyelid.  Dorsal coloration is similar to that of other Spea and 
Scaphiopus species: Usually a brown, gray, or olive background, mottled
 with darker spots posessing light-colored centers.  The ground color is 
variable and often matches the substrate.  The venter is light gray, white, or 
creamy.  Tadpoles have large, globular or ovoid bodies, reaching 70 mm in 
total length.  Their dorsal coloration is black, brown, or dark gray and 
flecked with metallic golds and rusts, while the abdomen displays an overall 
golden irridescence.  The spiracle is located low on the abdomen, and to the 
left side.

This species lives in western North America, in the United States and Canada.  In Calfornia, they occur east of the Sierra Nevada, and north of San Bernardino 
Co.  They occur throughout Nevada and Utah east of the Colorado River, push just
 south into northwest Arizona, and north into northwest Colorado and southwest 
Wyoming.  In Canada, Washington and Oregon, they are sandwiched between the 
Cascade and Rocky Mtn. ranges, but occur throughout lower Idaho.  They are 
found in arid regions, often associated with high desert scrub and sagebrush, 
but also reach past the pinion-juniper woodland, and into the spruce-fir belt 
at about 2800 m (9200 ft).  Little is known about abundance due, in part,
 to its explosive breeding habits, but it is often heard in temporary pools and
 flooded ditches immediately after winter and spring rains.  Activity varies
 with local conditions, but it is most active during and after winter, spring,
 and sometimes summer rains, when it may emerge to breed or forage on wet 
nights.

An explosive, opportunistic breeder, Spea intermontana is well adapted 
to the unpredictable and usually harsh seasons typical of the high desert areas
 it inhabits.  Males have loud calls which attract females and probably other
 males to temporary or vernal pools where breeding takes place.  Males are 
non-territorial, clumping and calling to females from partially submerged 
positions near the shore of pools. They appear to engage in a mad scramble for
 mates as they arrive.  After breeding, adults disappear underground by using
 the spades on their hindfeet to burrow backward into the soil, thereby 
avoiding evaporative water loss to the dry desert air.  Eggs are laid 
underwater in groups of 10-40, and depending on the type of vegetation and 
substrate available, are arranged in either flat sheets, short strings, or 
golfball sized clusters.  Tadpoles may be either herbivorous or carnivorous,
 depending on local environmental conditions.  The carnivorous morph has an
 enormous head, large jaw adductor muscles, and a sharp keratinous beak for 
tearing and cutting flesh.  Tadpoles develop quickly to avoid dessication in 
their rapidly drying temporary pools.

Officially unthreatened, but recent studies have detected possible declines
 (Orchard 1992)  and a repeat survey of historic collecting sites in the
 Sierra Nevada (Drost and Fellers 1996)  found no specimens of
 Spea intermontana.
