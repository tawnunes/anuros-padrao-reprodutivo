Acris crepitans is 1.6-3.5 cm long and has a blunt, pointed head with an occasional triangular marking.  Its back and legs are covered with various dark markings.  It has a middorsal bright green or brown stripe and the rear of its thigh has a distinct ragged dark stripe.  A white bar extends from its eye to its foreleg.  The body is slim-waisted and small while the skin is granular and warty.  Hind toes are extensively webbed and toe pads are poorly developed (Stebbins 2003).     
 
 
Acris crepitans paludicola and Acris crepitans blanchardi are recognized as subspecies.  A. c. paludicola  has smooth skin with a pinkish patterned coloration.  The throat remains pink, even for males during breeding season.  A. c. blanchardi by comparison is wartier, bulkier, and heavier with a light brown or gray uniform coloration (Conant and Collins 1991).   
 
 
Males have more ventral spotting than females (Stebbins 2003).   
 
 
 

","
Unlike most small frogs in its range, A. c. crepitans  does not leave the vicinity of water as an adult.  It is found at the edge of ponds and slow-moving streams, tending to avoid wooded areas and dense vegetation (Hulse McCoy and Censky 2001).   
 
A. c. blanchardi is found in Michigan, Ohio, Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and most of Texas.  A few have been spotted in Minnesota and New Mexico as well.  A. c. paludicola is found in marshes ranging from southwestern Louisiana to southeastern Texas (Conant and Collins 1991).   
 
 

","
Vocal calls are like the rapid clicking of pebbles, making a ""metallic gick gick gick"" sound. Rate of vocals is about 1 to 3 calls every second.  Breeding period usually lasts from April to July (Conant and Collins 1991).    Males can be seen calling from floating vegetation mats or from the banks of ponds.  Females seem to prefer males that call at a low pitch.   
 
It is active during both day and night in warm weather but only active during the day in spring and autumn.  Acris crepitans is an extraordinary leaper and can leap up to 38 times their standard body length (Hammerson 1999).        
 
 
It is carnivorous, eating various invertebrates and arthropods such as beetles, flies, spiders, ants, and true bugs (Hulse McCoy and Censky 2001).

Agalychnis callidryas, the red-eyed tree frog, is a slender, colorful, medium-sized frog.  Females measure up to 77 mm, and males to 59 mm (Savage 2002).  This frog has leaf-green to dark green dorsal surfaces; dark blue, purple, or brownish flanks, with cream-colored or yellow vertical or diagonal bars; blue or orange upper arms; thighs that are blue or orange on the anterior, posterior, and ventral surfaces;  orange hands and feet, except for the outermost digits on each; a white ventrum; and protuberant red eyes, with vertical pupils 
 (Savage 2002; Leenders 2001; Duellman 2001).  The back is sometimes marked with faint tranverse darker green lines (especially in individuals from Nicaragua or Costa Rica) or small white dots  
(Duellman 2001).   The average number of bars on the flanks increases in populations from north to south, with a mean of 5.0 bars in Mexico and a mean of 9.0 bars in Panama  
(Duellman 2001).  In some populations from the middle part of the range (Nicaragua and Costa Rica, on the Caribbean side), there is often a continuous, longitudinal yellowish stripe connecting the upper ends of the vertical bars and separating the blue flanks from the green dorsum  
(Duellman 2001).  
 
The skin is smooth both dorsally and ventrally  
(Savage 2002). Agalychnis callidryas has a rounded head and a truncated snout when viewed from above  
(Duellman 2001).  Eyes are large and directed sideways  
(Leenders 2001).  When this frog closes its eyes, transparent lower eyelids marked with a network of gold are apparent  
(Leenders 2001). It has distinct tympana 
(Savage 2002). The body is slender and somewhat flattened  
(Leenders 2001).  Fingers are short, about one-half webbed, and have moderately large discs  
(Duellman 2001).  The toes are short, about two-thirds webbed, and also have moderately large discs that are nearly as large as those on the fingers, with a narrow fold running from the heel to the disc of the fifth toe  
(Duellman 2001; Savage 2002). Adult males have paired vocal slits and a single internal median subgular vocal sac, as well as a grayish brown spinose nuptial pad at the base of each thumb  
(Savage 2002).   
 
 Young froglets (at least from Panama) are able to change color; they are green by day and change to purplish or reddish brown at night  
(Pyburn 1963).  In addition, young froglets have yellow rather than red eyes, and have lighter-colored flanks lacking whitish bars  
(Pyburn 1963). The red eye coloration appears first at the periphery of the eye at about two weeks post-metamorphosis, and over a period of several days spreads inward to make the iris wholly red  
(Starrett 1960).  
 
Agalychnis callidryas tadpoles are large, with a robust body that can measure 48 mm in total length at stage 34  
(Savage 2002).  The tail and caudal fins are moderately sized, with the tail tip narrowing to a thin flagellum  
(Savage 2002).  The spiracle is sinistral and lateroventral, while the vent is dextral  
(Savage 2002).  Eyes and nostrils are dorsolateral  
(Savage 2002). The mouth is anteroventral, with a small and complete oral disk, serrated beaks, and two upper plus three lower rows of denticles  
(Savage 2002; Duellman 2001).  The row of denticles just above the mouth has a small gap medially 
(Savage 2002). Labial papillae are present on the lower lip in one to three rows lateral and ventral to the mouth, and on the upper lip in one to two rows lateral to the mouth, but lacking directly above the mouth  
(Duellman 2001).  The tadpole body is olive gray dorsally, shading into a bluish gray speckled with olive-brown on the sides and undersides   
(Duellman 2001).  Larval caudal musculature is a light grayish brown while the caudal fins are transparent, but both are speckled with dark gray 
 (Duellman 2001).  
 
 

","
Red-eyed tree frogs are distributed from Mexico (Yucat√°n) to Panama, with an isolated report from the Cartagena Botanic Gardens in Colombia  
(Savage 2002; Ruiz-Carranza et al. 1996). They inhabit humid forests, primarily in lowlands and sometimes on premontane slopes up to 1,250 m  
(Leenders 2001).  
","
Agalychnis callidryas is nocturnally active.  This frog is arboreal and shelters on the underside of a broad leaf during the day and during the dry season, with limbs folded underneath its body (Leenders 2001).  It has also been found in bromeliads, though this appears to be rare (Duellman 2001). This species is abundant in suitable habitat (Stuart et al. 2008). 
         
 
Breeding occurs during the wet season (late May to November), beginning with the first rains (Pyburn 1970). Mating takes place throughout the rainy season but is particularly frequent in June, and occasionally peaks again in October (Donnelly and Guyer 1994).  Agalychnis callidryas generally prefers quiet pools of water with overhanging vegetation as breeding sites (but see the paragraph below for other types of sites used); the pools may be permanent, seasonal but long-lasting, or temporary (Warkentin et al. 2001; Pyburn 1970).  Males make aggressive calls, to deter other males from intruding onto their territories, and advertisement calls, to attract females  (Gray and Rand 1997).  The aggressive call sounds like a soft chuckle, and the advertisement call is a ""chack"" or ""chack-chack"", repeated at intervals of 8-60 seconds (Duellman 1967; Pyburn 1970; Duellman 2001).  The dominant call frequency ranges from 1.5-2.5 kHz  (Gray and Rand 1997). Calling begins at dusk and is most frequent in the evening, especially during rains, as males advertise for mates  
(Pyburn 1970).   However, Agalychnis callidryas have also been reported to participate in a brief daybreak chorus of advertisement calls, at a much higher call rate than evening or morning advertisement choruses  (Gray and Rand 1997; Duellman 2001).  On dry nights, males call from higher perches in the tree canopy (Pyburn 1970).  On wetter nights, or when the ponds are full, males begin calling from the ground and from small trees and bushes near the edges of ponds or backwaters (Pyburn 1970).  Calls are generally made from horizontal perches on leaves or branches, although vertical perches on stems are occasionally used (Pyburn 1970).  Males move about frequently while calling, changing both their positions and the direction of calling  (Pyburn 1970).  If precipitation or water level conditions are sufficient, males then descend to the breeding sites at the water's edge and continue calling (Savage 2002).  Females descend from the canopy, approach selected calling males in a straight line, and allow amplexus to take place (Pyburn 1970). Descent generally occurs slowly hand-over-hand, but parachuting has also been observed in this species, both in the wild (Pyburn 1964), and in experimental trials  
(Roberts 1994).  
 
Once amplexed, a female will carry the amplectant male into the water and remain there for about ten minutes (Pyburn 1970; D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  Pyburn  (1970) carried out experiments showing that the purpose of this behavior is to allow the female to absorb water through her skin, into her bladder, in order to make the jelly mass surrounding the clutch of eggs (Pyburn 1970). The amplectant pair then moves up into the trees, as the female searches for an appropriate egg deposition site on vegetation overhanging the water (Pyburn 1970; D'Orgeix and Turner 1995). Eggs are generally deposited on either the upper side (Pyburn 1970) or lower side (Fouquette 1968) of a broad leaf, as high as 12 feet over the water (Fouquette 1968). Sturdy plants and trees at the water's edge are preferred, but oviposition may also take place on emergent vegetation (Pyburn 1970). Egg clutches may also occasionally be deposited on substrates such as branches or fence wire (Pyburn 1970).  Very rarely eggs will be deposited on the ground  (Pyburn 1970).  This species has also been reported to sometimes make use of a wide variety of other types of sites, such as water-filled depressions made by human and pack animals, completely lacking overhanging vegetation; vines and small trees overhanging cavities of water in fallen trees; passionflower vines growing above a trickle of water from a pig pen; or by attaching eggs to the inside surface of water collection devices  (McCranie et al. 2003).  Occasionally clutches are found with leaves partially or completely folded over the eggs (Duellman 2001). If the deposition site is on top of a leaf, the parents may be protecting the clutch from sun and predators by folding the leaf edge over, where it adheres to the sticky jelly mass surrounding the eggs (Leenders 2001).  Other leaf-breeding frogs (Phyllomedusa iheringi, P. hypochondrialis, and P. sauvagii) protect their clutches within folded leaves (Pyburn 1970).  However,  Duellman (2001) cautions that for Agalychnis callidryas, the occasional folding may be due to attachment of the eggs to particular types of leaves more prone to curling, as neither he nor others (e.g. Pyburn) have observed this species actively curling leaves during oviposition. Pyburn  (1970), in fact, specifically mentions that Agalychnis callidryas lays its eggs on open leaves, in contrast to other phyllomedusine frogs. 
 
Fertilization occurs immediately after egg deposition (Leenders 2001).  Occasionally amplectant pairs are attacked by single males, as the intruder attempts to dislodge the first male or attach himself alongside or on the first male's back (Pyburn 1970; D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  This strategy sometimes succeeds, as molecular analysis has confirmed that multiple paternity does occur and that the second male can contribute significantly to clutch fertilization in the wild  (D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  Briggs (2008) conducted male-displacement trials, where a male at least 5 mm longer in SVL was placed into a covered 5-gallon bucket with a recently amplexed pair and checked every hour with red light, but found no male takeovers occurred.  Over a three-year study period, Briggs (2008) reported that mating patterns varied; red-eyed tree frogs showed evidence of size-assortative mating in one of the three years and evidence of large-male mating advantage in another one of the three years (the driest year). 

Clutches consist of about 40 green eggs, each surrounded by a clear jelly coat, with each egg having a diameter of about 3.7 mm at oviposition and 5.2 mm when mature enough to hatch (Pyburn 1963; Warkentin 2000a; Warkentin 2002).  The entire clutch is itself surrounded in more jelly, which is sticky and serves to adhere the clutch to the substrate as well as to prevent desiccation (Pyburn 1963; Pyburn 1970; Warkentin et al. 2006). Yolk color is consistent within clutches, but varies between clutches, from cream to gold to turquoise to lime green  (Warkentin et al. 2006); as the clutches get older, the yolk changes color from pale green to yellow  (Duellman 2001). Females may lay multiple clutches (up to five) in a single night (Pyburn 1970).  In between clutches, the female carries the amplectant male down into the water again as she rehydrates (D'Orgeix and Turner 1995).  Ovulation is likely to occur twice during the reproductive season, given that gravid females containing ovulated eggs were also found to have equal numbers of immature half-size eggs still within the ovary, (Duellman 1963; Duellman 2001). This observation also fits with the second peak in mating sometimes observed near the end of the rainy season  (Donnelly and Guyer 1994).  Fertilization success is high, with Briggs (2008) noting 100% fertilization in 54 of 56 experimental clutches and reporting that this did not differ from her field observations. 
 
Since the egg clutches are attached to vegetation overhanging the water, hatching tadpoles generally fall into the water below as soon as they hatch (Pyburn 1963). Thus hatching involves a shift in habitat, from aerial to aquatic, with a concomitant change in the suite of potential predators and selection pressures  (Warkentin 1995). Occasionally, hatching tadpoles may also fall onto the ground (Pyburn 1970).  Tadpoles are able to live out of water for up to 20 hours (Valerio 1971). Those that fall onto the ground or remain stuck to the leaf may still survive if a later rain washes them into standing water, or if they are able to flip themselves into the water by thrashing about with their tails  (Pyburn 1963; Pyburn 1970).  
 
 Agalychnis callidryas shows remarkable adaptive plasticity in the timing of hatching (Warkentin 1995). In undisturbed clutches, embryos develop essentially synchronously but hatch asynchronously, from six to ten days post-oviposition (Warkentin 1995; Warkentin 2005).  Most undisturbed embryos will hatch at about seven days, with the study population in Panama hatching on average at about 6 - 7 days and the study population in Costa Rica hatching at about 7 - 8 days (Warkentin 2005). However, if disturbed, Agalychnis callidryas embryos can undergo early, relatively synchronous hatching, as early as 4 days in Panama  (Warkentin 2000b) or 5 days in Costa Rica  (Warkentin 1995).  Accelerated hatching can occur in entire clutches or small groups of eggs within a clutch, in response to at least four different natural risks: snake attack (Warkentin 1995), wasp attack (Warkentin 2000b), fungus infestation  
(Warkentin et al. 2001), and flooding or submersion (Pyburn 1963; Warkentin 2002). Hypoxia from exposure to hypoxic gas mixtures also induces early hatching  (Warkentin 2002). Fungal attack, flooding, and hypoxia result in more gradual early hatching than immediate threat of predation (Warkentin 2000b). 

The decision to hatch is a behavioral decision since highly energetic movement is required; embryos that remain motionless do not hatch, even though they have reached an appropriate developmental stage  (Warkentin 1995; Warkentin et al. 2001). Mechanical disturbance is both sufficient and necessary to induce rapid, synchronous hatching, since simultaneous touching and jiggling of the eggs by poking forceps into the surrounding jelly results in rapid hatching  
(Warkentin 1995). However, Agalychnis callidryas embryos do not respond to all mechanical disturbances by rapid hatching (Warkentin 1995). Five-day-old embryos are insensitive to movements of the leaf substrate caused by simply touching the egg jelly coats, or collecting and transporting egg clutches, or even high winds and heavy rain  (Warkentin 1995).  The plasticity in timing and synchronization of hatching, particularly early hatching, is thus not simply a response to mechanical stimulus intensity (Warkentin 2000b), nor is it a response to visual or chemical cues from  snake or wasp predators, or cues such as wetting of the clutch from precipitation (Warkentin 2005).  Rather, experiments have shown that red-eyed tree frog embryos assess the temporal pattern of substrate-borne vibrations when making the decision to hatch  (Warkentin 2005; Warkentin et al. 2006; Warkentin et al. 2007).  Further, they do not hatch at the earliest possible moment following stimulation, but wait some seconds to minutes to evaluate the information before deciding to hatch  (Warkentin et al. 2007). 
  
Cohen et al. (2016) showed that arboreal embryos of Agalychnis callidryas can hatch very rapidly (6.5 - 49 seconds) in order to escape from snake attacks.  They identified three stages of hatching: pre-rupture shaking and gaping, vitelline membrane rupture near the snout, and muscular thrashing to escape. Electron microscopy revealed hatching glands densely clustered on the snout that are filled with vesicles that release their contents rapidly at hatching. Characterization of the postulated hatching enzyme remains to be accomplished. Comparative studies of the glands should reveal differences among taxa to determine whether this or other novel mechanisms are employed. 

A video clip is available of Agalychnis callidryas embryos undergoing accelerated hatching resulting from snake attack.  Developing Agalychnis callidryas embryos are commonly preyed on by snakes (e.g., Leptodeira septentrionalis)  (Warkentin 1995). Snake attack induces embryos to hatch up to 30% early (as early as five days post-oviposition), rapidly (within seconds to minutes), and relatively synchronously, as the entire clutch hatches within a few minutes rather than over several days 
(Warkentin 1995).  Embryos are able to distinguish between the potentially lethal event of a snake attack and the relatively non-dangerous event of a rainstorm by the duration and timing of resulting vibrations  (Warkentin et al. 2006). When vibrational recordings produced by a snake attack or by a rainstorm are edited and played back, such that the timing of vibrations more closely resembles the other stimulus, the hatching response shifts in the expected direction: higher for more snakelike vibrations, lower for more rain-like vibrations (Warkentin et al. 2006). Tadpoles first enter the water on hatching, shifting their habitat from aerial to aquatic as they fall from from the overhanging leaves to which the egg clutch was attached  (Pyburn 1963). If undisturbed by snakes, embryos tend to delay hatching until they are about seven days old, because more developed larvae are less vulnerable to aquatic predators such as shrimp and fish  (Warkentin 1995; Warkentin 2005).    
 
Developing Agalychnis callidryas embryos are also frequently vulnerable to predation by several different species of polybid wasps 
(Warkentin 2000b; Warkentin et al. 2006). Wasp predation, like snake predation, induces early and rapid hatching of Agalychnis callidryas embryos  
(Warkentin 2000b). Interestingly, the number of embryos hatching is different, depending on the predation scenario. Warkentin  
(2000b) reports that embryos hatch individually or in small groups (the ones grasped by a wasp, plus sometimes the nearest neighbors) in response to wasps, which consume a single embryo at a time, whereas whole clutches hatch in response to snakes, which eat entire clutches. A video featuring Karen Warkentin's work is available.
 
Fungal infection of Agalychnis callidryas egg clutches by a filamentous ascomycete (family Phaeosphaeriaceae) also induces early hatching  
(Warkentin et al. 2001).  While eggs in non-infected clutches hatch in a spatially random order, hatching in infected clutches is non-random  
(Warkentin et al. 2001).  In infected clutches, those eggs which are specifically in direct contact with fungal hyphae will hatch early if they are at least five days old (Warkentin et al. 2001). Adjacent empty eggs can form a ""barrier"" which the fungus does not typically cross, allowing the remaining embryos to continue developing within the clutch (Warkentin et al. 2001). In contrast to the immediate, synchronous hatching in response to snake or wasp attack, fungus-infected clutches that are  at a sufficient stage of development hatch over a period of days, but at an average younger age than healthy clutches (Warkentin et al. 2001). 
 
Agalychnis callidryas larvae have unusually large, elaborate external gills for anurans, consisting of a gill trunk on each side of the body, with one row of branched filaments (Pyburn 1963).  The presence of large, elaborate gills is likely to indicate oxygen limitation throughout development, especially since the embryos of this species develop in large, closely packed eggs under quite warm conditions (Warkentin 2000a). Larvae show strikingly rapid external gill loss on hatching, with substantial gill regression occurring as fast as three minutes post-hatching (Warkentin 2000a). Newly hatched tadpoles respire via internal gills, as well as cutaneously (Warkentin 2000a). The increase in environmentally available oxygen upon leaving the egg has been experimentally demonstrated to be the primary stimulus for external gill loss in this species, with the process of hatching itself playing a secondary role in triggering gill loss (Warkentin 2000a).  Since the presence of external gills creates drag in the water (Dudley et al. 1991), rapid gill loss at the time these tadpoles first enter the water may enhance swimming performance, which could enable survival on exposure to aquatic predators  
(Warkentin 2000a).  In this species (and probably other anurans with external gills), the loss of external gills at hatching appears to be mediated by prostaglandins of the E family, or PGEs  (Warkentin and Wassersug 2001). In contrast, the loss of internal gills is mediated by thyroid hormone at the time of metamorphosis  (Shi 2000).  
    
Tadpoles of Red-Eyed Tree Frogs suspend themselves vertically in the water column to feed, with heads near the water surface (Savage 2002).  They are primarily water-column filter feeders (Vonesh and Warkentin 2006).  Gray and Nishikawa (1995) reported that in the laboratory, adult Agalychnis callidryas preferred crickets and moths as prey. To our knowledge, no field study has yet been published on the diet of adults of this species. 
 
Eggs of Agalychnis callidryas are vulnerable to predation by arboreal snakes (such as the cat-eyed snake, Leptodeira septentrionalis), several species of polybid wasps (particularly Polybia rejecta), monkeys, and fly larvae (Hirtodrosophila batracida) 
 
(Warkentin 1995; Warkentin 2000b; Warkentin et al. 2001; Warkentin et al. 2006). In addition, eggs are susceptible to mortality from fungal infection by a filamentous ascomycete (family Phaeosphaeriaceae)  
(Warkentin et al. 2001). Tadpoles may be preyed on by aquatic predators such as shrimp (Macrobrachium americanum) and fish (Brachyraphis rhabdophora)  
(Warkentin 1995), as well as giant water bugs foraging below the water surface (Belostoma sp.) 
(Vonesh and Warkentin 2006). Newly metamorphosed froglets may be consumed by aquatic spiders foraging at or above the water surface (Thaumasia sp.) 
(Vonesh and Warkentin 2006). Predators on juvenile and adult Red-Eyed Tree Frogs include snakes (Warkentin 1995), as well as birds and bats  
(Leenders 2001).   
 
Although phyllomedusine (leaf-breeding) frogs do not have the same sort of highly toxic compounds as other brightly colored frogs such as the dendrobatids, their skin does contain high levels of biologically active peptides (Mignogna et al. 1997). The skin of Agalychnis callidryas has been shown to contain five different families of biologically active peptides: tachykinins, bradykinins, caerulein, opioid peptides (dermorphin and [Hyp6]dermorphin), and sauvagine  
(Mignogna et al. 1997).   

In addition to larvae being able to sense vibrations, it has now been shown that adult male Red-Eyed Tree Frogs also use vibrational signaling, in  male-male aggressive interactions (Caldwell et al., 2010). The authors point out that substrate vibrations may be far more important in communication by arboreal vertebrates than had previously been realized.  
During contests over females, male Red-Eyed Tree Frogs emit ""chuckle"" calls and perform tremulation displays by shaking a branch rapidly with their hind legs. Tremulations only occurred when two males were within 2 m of each other or were on the same plant, and were often immediately followed by wrestling. To test whether the vibrations were important, various combinations of displays were made using a robotic frog on a wooden frame near a branch occupied by a live frog, plus a shaker on the branch where the live frog sat.  In some tests, the robotic frog moved up and down, for a visual display, but no branch shaking was done; in others, the branch was vibrated but the robotic frog did not move; and in some tests, both visual and vibrational displays were made.  The live males responded aggressively to all displays, both visual and vibrational, but only shook their own branch when vibrations were felt from the shaker (Caldwell et al. 2010).

This species can tolerate some habitat modification, such as in areas where selective logging has been done, but is thought not to be able to live where the forest has been heavily degraded  
(Stuart et al. 2008). However, McCranie et al.  
(2003) report finding Agalychnis callidryas eggs and tadpoles in a wide variety of breeding sites in Honduras, including some in heavily deforested areas (see Life History section above for a description).  

All five Agalychnis species (A. annae, A. callidryas, A. moreletii, A. saltator, and A. spurrelli) are now under CITES protection, under Appendix II (as of March 21, 2010). Within the past decade the U.S. alone has imported 221,960 Agalychnis frogs, according to the Species Survival Network (SSN).

This species was featured in News of the Week 4 April 2022:
The evolutionary transition to terrestriality and terrestrial breeding in amphibians has occurred repeatedly, but have the required key adaptations, e.g., resistance to desiccation and toxic ammonia build-up, likewise been repeated? M√©ndez-Narv√°ez and Warkentin (2022) examined this question in a comparative study of four frog lineages, contrasting either short (Agalychnis callidryas, Engystomops pustulosus) or long (Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni, Leptodactylus fragilis) larval exposure to desiccating conditions. They carried out experiments in an open lab in the rainforests of Gamboa, Panama (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution). By manipulating environmental conditions (wet vs. dry) and tracking levels of ammonia and urea excretion, they evaluated the tolerance to ammonia exhibited by larvae of each species. They found the two species (H. fleischmanni, L. fragilis) which experience the highest risk of desiccation showed clear evidence for urea production and for pronounced increases in urea excretion, whereas the other two did not. Without urea excretion, the larvae of the high-risk species could experience lethal conditions, providing a clear case for the adaptive value of urea production in these species. They also compared the two foam-nesting species (E. pustulosus, L. fragilis) and two leaf-breeding species (H. fleischmanni, A. callidryas), demonstrating the similar changes in nitrogen metabolism in response to desiccation risk in both comparisons. Their study provides important evidence for the potentially key role of adaptive plasticity in mediating major evolutionary changes. (by Kyle Summers)

Agalychnis saltator is a relatively small red-eyed frog, with adult males ranging from 34 to 54 mm and the larger females ranging from 57 to 66 mm.  This frog can be identified by its red eyes with vertical pupils, and its orange hands and feet.  They have extensive webbing between the fingers and toes and large suction disks at end of each digit  
(Leenders 2001).  The adults are light or dark leaf green with some individuals having one to several raised yellow spots on their dorsal side.  The sides of the body and anterior and posterior surface of the thighs are bluish purple.  Their iris color can range from orange to tomato red.  Their ventral side are cream anteriorly with a yellow or orange tint posteriorly.  Other than the size difference between the males and females, males develop a dark or black patch on the inside of the base of the thumb during mating season  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  This species closely resembles Agalychnis callidryas (red-eyed leaf frog) but with some differences.  It has a uniform dark blue or purple flanks instead of vertical white, yellow, or cream bars found in the red-eyed leaf frog.  Another difference is that Agalychnis saltator changes its color from uniform leaf-green during the day to tan or brown during the night, while the red-eyed leaf frog just change their hue 
(Leenders 2001).  
 

","
This red-eyed leaf frog occurs in the humid lowlands of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  It is found in the same areas as Agalychnis callidryas  
(Leenders 2001).  They inhabit swamps during the mating season (wet season) and canopy trees in primary forest during the dry season  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005). 
","
During the mating season, these tree frogs breed on vines that overhang temporary ponds in forested areas (Leenders 2001).  Males give off a short,soft, high pitched ""peep"" or ""chirp"" at the breeding site.  The call has a long interval which can last up to 30 seconds.  Calls are made from the perch of the trees around the breeding sites  
(Guyer and Donnelly 2005).  They only mate after periods of heavy precipitation.  Eggs are laid on mosses that cover the vines.  It is during this time that the frogs are most prone to predation.  Ants have been observed preying on the frog eggs. Various species of snakes feed on both eggs and adults.  They are known as the parachuting red-eyed leaf frog because in order to move rapidly to mating grounds, males leap from considerable height to leaves of a plant.  While jumping, this frogs extends its limbs and spreads out the skin between its fingers and toes  
(Leenders 2001).

","
All five Agalychnis species (A. annae, A. callidryas, A. moreletii, A. saltator, and A. spurrelli) have just received CITES protection, under Appendix II (as of March 21, 2010). Within the past decade the U.S. alone has imported 221,960 Agalychnis frogs, according to the Species Survival Network (SSN).

The snout-vent length is 48.2 to 56.4 mm in adult males from Costa Rica and 60.2 to 71.8 mm in adult females from Costa Rica (Duellman 2001).  Panamanian individuals are larger, with males measuring 67.6-75.6 mm and females 81.6 to 86.7 mm, and one female from Colombia measuring 92.8 mm (Duellman 2001).  The head is as broad as it is long, with a snout that is subelliptical when viewed from above.  The eyes are large, with reticulated lower eyelids.  The diameter of the tympanum is equal to about one-half diameter of the eye (Savage 2002).  The tympanum is moderately distinct, with the upper and posterior edges covered by a dermal fold (Duellman 2001)  This dermal fold runs from the posterior of the eye over the tympanum, and continues as a flap to the axilla (Duellman 2001).  The body is thin (Duellman 2001).  Dorsally the skin is smooth, as are the ventral surfaces of the limb, while the belly and proximal ventral surfaces of the thigh are granular (Duellman 2001).  Upper arms are slender but forearms are robust, with a noticeable dermal fold running across the elbow and along the ventrolateral edge of the forearm down to the disc of finger IV (Duellman 2001).  The fingers and toes have discs (Duellman 2001). Fingers are about 3/4 webbed; toes are fully webbed in Panamanian specimens but slightly less so in 
Costa Rican specimens (Duellman 2001).  Savage (2002) reported the webbing formula for fingers as I 2--2 II 1-1 ¬æ III 1-1 IV and for toes as I 1-2- II 1-2- III 1-1 ¬Ω IV 1 ¬Ω - IV.  There are flattened, bifid subarticular tubercles under fingers III and IV (Duellman 2001). The thenar tubercle is greatly enlarged but the palmar tubercle is not present.  On the hindlimbs, skin on the shank tends to form a thin longitudinal fold on the ventrolateral and ventromedian surfaces, and a thin dermal fold extends across the heel and along the outer edge of the tarsus to the base of the disc on the fifth toe (Duellman 2001). There is a strong tarsal fold extending the entire length of the tarsus (Duellman 2001).  On the posteroventral surfaces of the thighs, a distinct row of granules is present (Duellman 2001). There are many plantar tubercles, and supernumerary tubercles on proximal segments of the toes (Duellman 2001).   The inner metatarsal tubercle is low and elliptical, and there is no outer metatarsal tubercle.  In adult males, there are spiny, brown nuptial pads on the base of the thumb, as well as short, paired vocal slits and a slightly distensible single median subgular vocal sac (Savage 2002). 

The color of the frog changes from day to night (metachrosis).  During the day, dorsal surfaces of the head, body, limbs, fourth fingers, and fourth and fifth toes are light, yellowy green, turning darker green at night.  Dorsal surfaces often have black-bordered white, pustular spots; this species is the only Agalychnis species in which the white spots may have black outlines, and the black borders seem to be present in all Panamanian and Colombian specimens but lacking in some Costa Rican specimens (Duellman 2001).  The upper surfaces of the forearms, flanks, belly, anterior and posterior thigh surfaces, webbing, and most digits are orange (Duellman 2001).  Individuals from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, had a yellow chin and throat, while those from Tacarcuna, Panama had a creamy white throat and chest, and those from the Peninsula de Osa, Costa Rica, had a cream throat the chest and a pale orange belly (Duellman 2001).   In some individuals there is a dark green stripe separating the green dorsum from the orange flanks (Duellman 2001).  Yellowish cream stripes run from the elbow to the disc of finger IV, along the edge of the tarsus from the heel to the disc of toe V, and across the anal flap (Duellman 2001). The iris is dark red, and the palpebral reticulations are greenish gold.  Juveniles are green during the day but reddish brown at night (Savage 2002).  
	

The length of the larva is 41 mm at stage 35.  The body is robust and the tail is moderate, its tip tapering to a thin flagellum.  Eyes are located dorsolaterally and directed laterally.  Nares are dorsolateral, directed anteriorly (Savage 2002).  The mouth is anteroventral, with a small and entire oral disc that has beaks and 1/3 rows of denticles (Savage 2002).  Both beaks are serrated, and there are two or three rows of papillae lateral and ventral to the mouth. The spiracle is lateroventral and sinistral, and the vent is dextral. The body coloration is bluish gray with dark brown flecks on the sides and the anterior portion of the fins.  The caudal musculature is reticulated brown and gray anteriorly (Savage 2002).

","
This species is found in tropical and subtropical humid lowlands, as well as the lower portions of premontane zones of southeastern and southwestern Costa Rica, through Panama, the Pacific lowlands of Colombia and northwestern Ecuador, at elevations ranging from 15-750 m (Savage 2002; Jungfer et al. 2008).  It is also found in inland intermittent freshwater marshes and pools smaller than 8 ha (Sutart et al. 2008).

","
Agalychnis spurrelli is a nocturnal, arboreal canopy-dwelling species, with unusual methods of locomotion (Savage 2002).  It moves through the canopy by climbing vines and branches using a hand-over-hand locomotion.  It also parachutes while leaping, to move horizontally (Savage 2002).  The parachuting leaps are accomplished by spreading out the hands and feet so that the frog's large, extensively webbed feet are parallel to the substrate (Savage 2002).  The frog can maintain an angle of descent up to 45¬∫ from the vertical for considerably long distances (Savage 2002).  It can also execute turns during the descent, about 2 m from the ground (Duellman 2001).  



Gliding Leaf Frog: slow motion gliding footage (fast forward 1 minute)

This species is associated with temporary ponds with dense foliage hanging over the water, where explosive breeding takes place (IUCN 2006).  Breeding occurs with the rainy season, usually May through October.  It breeds in woodland pools and water-filled cavities in logs (Duellman 2001).  Male calls are described by Savage (2002) as a ""single, low-pitched moan"" repeated every 10 to 17 seconds, and by Scott and Starrett (1974) as a very weak, sometimes erratic ""Wuk! Wuk! Wuk!"".  Call duration is 340 to 400 milliseconds with a pulse rate of 60 to 90 per second.  The dominant frequency is 0.44 to 0.7 kHz (Duellman 2001). 
Females lay egg masses on leafy foliage, mostly 1.5 - 3 m above the water but as high as 8 m (Scott and Starrett 1974).  Egg masses are generally deposited on the upper side of the leaf (Duellman 2001). Clutches vary in size from 14-67 eggs each (Scott and Starrett 1974).  Males have been observed scraping eggs off the leaves with rotary movements of the feet (Scott and Starrett 1974).  The eggs hatch six days after oviposition, and the tadpoles ""hang"" head up in the open midwater (Scott and Starrett 1974).   

Common egg predators include dragonfly nymphs, dytiscid beetles and aquatic hemipterans.  Scott and Starrett (1974) have observed adult Purple Gallinules (Porphyrio porphyrio)eating eggs and Green Kingfishers (Chloroceryle americana) eating tadpoles.  Arboreal snakes prey on the adult frogs.

","

","
The current Red List status for this species is Least Concern (LC). The species' population trend is decreasing, but not at a fast enough rate to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.  Possible threats include habitat loss due to agricultural development, illegal crops, logging, and human settlement. More research is needed on population trends, as well as the establishment of additional protected areas (Jungfer et al. 2008).

All five Agalychnis species (A. annae, A. callidryas, A. moreletii, A. saltator, and A. spurrelli) have just received CITES protection, under Appendix II (as of March 21, 2010). Within the past decade the U.S. alone has imported 221,960 Agalychnis frogs, according to the Species Survival Network (SSN). 
","

","
The species was first described by Boulenger (1913). The name given is a patronym for Dr. H. G. F. Spurrell, who collected the type series in Colombia (Duellman 2001).  Roberts (1994a,b) pointed out similarities between this species and A. saltator in breeding behavior and locomotion.

Aplastodiscus leucopygius is a green tree frog that belongs to the A. albosignatus species group (Faivovich et al. 2005), in the Aplastodiscus (Hyla) albosignata complex (Cruz and Peixoto 1985). It is a medium sized frog for the group (35-45 mm SVL). Snout rounded in profile. Tympanum large, diameter about 2/3 to ¬æ of the eye diameter, moderate tympanic fold; single vocal sac. Finger discs large. Dorsum smooth; diffuse glands along the entire flank. Venter granular. A white outlined transverse ridge above the vent composes the cloacal ornamentation. Prominent ovate inner metatarsal tubercle; heel with a fold and well-developed white calcar (Heyer et al. 1990). 

Coloration: Dorsum bright green with small white spots. Belly creamy yellow with bits of white pigment flecks. Tarsal and supra-vent folds white highlighted, with dots spread laterally.  Posterior surface of thigh unpigmented. Iris gold centrally and red or orange peripherally. Bones green (Heyer et al. 1990).  

The tadpole has a mean total length of 52.4 mm at Gosner stage 28. Body elliptical in dorsal view, gray or light brown.  Eyes dorsal.  Snout rounded; nares kidney-like, closer to the eye than to the snout. Oral apparatus ventral. Marginal papillae in a single row; submarginal papillae present. LTRF 2(2)/4(1). Lower jaw V-shaped.  Spiracle sinistral, directed upward, with the end point white. Vent tube dextral. Tail 69% of the total length, being the highest point at the first third, with rounded tip. Moderate tail musculature, with dark transverse bars. Fins reddish; ventral fin lower than the dorsal (Gomes and Peixoto 2002). 
","
Aplastodiscus leucopygius is found in the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil, in the states of Rio de Janeiro, southern Minas Gerais, and eastern S√£o Paulo.  It lives near streams or temporary ponds associated with woodlands in the coastal mountains of southeastern Brazil, from 800 m up to 1,600 m a.s.l. 
","
Males of this species call at night from high branches and leaves of trees (above 2 m), near permanent forest streams and rivulets, and less commonly at the forest edge (Heyer et al. 1990; Haddad and Sawaya 2000; Ribeiro et al. 2005). Each chorus can be composed of 4 or 5 calling males (Heyer et al. 1990).  Males give three different vocalization types: advertisement calls, courtship calls, and multi-note (aggressive) calls. The advertisement call is the most common vocalization (Haddad and Sawaya 2000), which sounds like a horn (vocalizations can be heard on Haddad et al. 2005). Calling males use only one pond per reproductive period (Haddad and Sawaya 2000).

A. leucopygius is acoustically active throughout the year, but with a peak in activity during the rainy season, between October and March (Feio 1990; Haddad and Sawaya 2000).  Gravid females and effective reproduction, however, were observed only from December to February in the Serra do Japi (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). An elaborate courtship takes place with a sequence of stereotypical mutual touches between the male and female, and the male eventually guides the female to the concealed subterranean nest (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). The female apparently inspects the nest before accepting the male (Haddad and Sawaya 2000), as is the case for another hylid species, Hypsiboas faber (Martins and Haddad 1988). A. leucopygius lays unpigmented eggs in a floating layer in these subterranean constructed nests, where the larvae also spend their early lives after hatching (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). Nests are made in muddy soil or banks near ponds and rivulets (Haddad and Sawaya 2000). Flooding washes the exotrophic tadpoles out of the nests, after which they occupy temporary ponds or streams (Haddad and Sawaya 2000; reproductive mode 5 of Haddad and Prado 2005).  Tadpoles can inhabit streams varying in depth from 0.5 to 1 m, with the bottom composed of silt and litter. 

A detailed description and discussion of the elaborate courtship behaviour can be found in Haddad and Sawaya (2000), including a description of the three types of vocalization, sexual selection, and the egg clutches, along with a discussion on the evolution of these behaviours and oviposition site. 
","

","
Its range is within protected areas, like the Parque Estadual Nova Baden, at Lambari-MG, RPPN Ovidio Pires, at Bom Jardim-MG, Parque Estadual do Ibitipoca, at Lima Duarte-MG, Serra do Japi, at Jundia√≠-SP, Parque Municipal do Itapetinga, at Atibaia-SP, Esta√ß√£o Biol√≥gica de Borac√©ia, at Sales√≥polis-SP, Parque √Ågua Funda, at S√£o Paulo, APA Federal da Bacia do Rio Para√≠ba do Sul, at Aruj√°-SP, Parque Nacional da Serra dos √ìrg√£os, at Teres√≥polis-RJ, and Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, at Itatiaia-RJ (Cruz and Peixoto, 1985; Feio, 1990; Heyer et al., 1990; Haddad and Sawaya, 2000). A. leucopygius was apparently not affected by factors producing a drastic drop in abundance of several other anuran species in the Esta√ß√£o Biol√≥gica da Borac√©ia in 1979, as reported by Heyer et al. (1988).
","

","
The epithet of this species (leucopygius) is related to the white parts of the cloaca and the calcaneous appendix. 

This species was featured in News of the Week May 9, 2022: 
Habitat fragmentation and infectious diseases are two of the biggest global threats to amphibians, but how do these two threats interact? Besides leading to stress and local extirpations in vulnerable wildlife populations, habitat fragmentation can reduce genetic diversity, which in turn may increase susceptibility to disease. Belasen et al. (2022) evaluated relationships between habitat fragmentation, genetic diversity, and disease susceptibility in six frog species endemic to Brazil‚Äôs Atlantic Forest, an amphibian diversity hotspot. They specifically tested whether habitat fragmentation reduces diversity in a genetic region related to immune function (MHC IIB), which is associated with amphibian susceptibility to the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). They found that habitat fragmentation was associated with genetic erosion at MHC IIB across species, and individuals that were MHC IIB heterozygotes (‚Äúhybrids‚Äù) experienced reduced Bd infection risk. The most severe genetic erosion at MHC IIB occurred in forest specialist frogs including Aplastodiscus leucopygius. Forest specialist frogs also exhibited increased Bd infections (higher prevalence and loads) in fragmented habitats. Overall their results showed that habitat fragmentation impacts MHC IIB diversity and potential disease susceptibility in frogs, with the greatest impacts in sensitive forest specialists.

Bokermannohyla luctuosa is a large treefrog (SVL 55-70 mm) belonging to the B. circumdata species group (Faivovich et al. 2005). Body robust. The snout is rounded and short, nostrils slightly protuberant directed laterally. Eye large, protruding. The tympanum is large, nearly elliptical, its diameter about 1.2x the eye diameter. Supratympanic fold originating at the posterior corner of the orbit and reaching the shoulder. A single subgular vocal sac, males with vocal slits. Prepollex well developed, with curved spine. Fingers and toes robust. The finger and toe discs are large, nearly rounded, smaller than tympanum. Dorsal and throat texture smooth; belly and undersurfaces of thighs, and anal region granular. Dorsum brown, with darker transverse bars. Flanks pale cream. Posterior surface of the thighs brown with distinct black vertical not bifurcated, interrupted stripes. Belly cream.  This species is sexually dimorphic, with males having vocal slits, a prepollex on each hand and hypertrophied arms (Pombal and Haddad 1993; Napoli 2000).  

The tadpoles have total length of 15 mm at Gosner 25. The oral apparatus is large and directed ventrally, oral disc with a double row of marginal papillae, interrupted dorsally; upper and lower jaw heavy, finely serrated, lower jaw V-shaped; LTRF 2(2)/3(1). The body is ovoid in dorsal view, with a robust tail. Dorsal fin higher than the ventral; dorsal fin origin at the body-tail juncture. The eyes are small and lateral; the nostrils are dorsal. The spiracle is sinistral, positioned on the midline at the posterior part of the body. The color of the dorsum in preservative is brown; throat and belly transparent (Pombal and Haddad 1993).   

","
Bokermannohyla luctuosa lives associated to temporary ponds inside forests, it is also rarely found near forest streams. The species is distributed along the Atlantic Rain Forest in the Serra da Mantiqueira and Serra do Mar, in southwestern Rio de Janeiro, eastern Minas Gerais, and eastern S√É¬£o Paulo States, in eastern Brazil, above 800 m (Pombal and Haddad 1993; Napoli 2000). 
","
 

Bokermannohyla luctuosa lives inside woodlands, near temporary ponds and cascading forest streams. It is more commonly encountered on days with low temperature and soft rains (pers. obs). The adults frequently occur on the leaf-litter; Giaretta et al. (1999) report that B. luctuosa contributed 7.9% of the litter frog fauna in the summer in their study site. This species is rarely heard. Males call after midnight on low vegetation (66 cm above ground) in the rainy season from November to March. The advertisement call was described by Pombal and Haddad (1993). The call is given sporadically; call duration 0.60 s. Inactive individuals can also be found on the ground, near large permanent ponds or brooks (Haddad and Sazima 1992; Pombal and Haddad 1993; Napoli 2000; Vasconcelos and Giaretta 2003; Ribeiro et al. 2005; pers. obs.). This species lays eggs with large gelatinous capsules in water-filled depressions (7 cm in diameter) in the ground, near ponds and rivulets. It can also oviposit directly in running waters (Mode 2 and 4 of Haddad and Prado 2005). 
The defense strategy is to emit a distress call and to open the mouth widely (Haddad and Pombal 1993; Haddad et al. 2008). 
","

","
Its range is within protected areas, like the Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, at Itatiaia-RJ, Parque Municipal do Itapetinga, at Atibaia-SP and Serra do Japi, at Jundia√É¬≠-SP. It is a common species within its range (Vasconcelos and Giaretta, 1999; Haddad et al., 2008).
","

","
The karyotype is composed of 2n=24 (Pombal and Haddad 1993).  

This genus is dedicated to Werner Carlos Augusto Bokermann (1929√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú
1995), as homage to his contribution to the knowledge of Brazilian anurans (Faivovich et al. 2005). The epithet is a Latin adjective (luctuosus=sad), in allusion to the mournful calls heard late in the night (Pombal and Haddad 1993). There is a detailed drawing of the posterior surface of the thigh of this species (a distinctive trait within the group) and a comparison with other members of the species group in Vasconcelos and Giaretta (1999).

The size of the Dendropsophus ebraccatus varies between regional populations. The average snout-vent length of an adult male ranges from 23.63 - 26.75 mm (Ohmer et. al 2009), while females are slightly larger, reaching 36.5 mm (Duellman 1970). The species has a short, truncated snout, and its head is flat and wider than its body (Duellman 1970). The eyes are large compared to the head, and the pupil is horizontal (Leenders 2016). Adults have vomerine teeth (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013). There is a thin dermal fold that extends from the back edge of the eye to near the arm. This fold covers the upper edge of the tympanum, which is roughly one-fourth the size of the eye (Savage 2002) and has a distinct ridge on the front edge (Duellman 1970). Adult males have paired vocal slits and a single extensible vocal sac. The skin on the dorsum is smooth, while the skin on the ventrum is granular (Savage 2002).

The limbs are relatively short. The front limbs have an extensive axillary membrane and are slightly more robust than the hind limbs. The tips of all the digits have discs, with the discs being larger on the hands than the feet (Duellman 1970). The disc on the third digit of the front limb is larger than the tympanum (Savage 2002). The front foot has webbing covering roughly half the length of the digits. The webbing between the first and second digit is vestigial, and extends from the middle of the penultimate phalanx on the second digit to the base of the penultimate phalanges on the third and fourth digits. The webbing on the hind foot is more extensive, covering roughly three-quarters of the length of the digits. The webbing starts at the base of the toe disc on the first digit, continues to the distal end of the penultimate phalanx on the second digit, then connects to the base of the penultimate phalanx on the third digit. The webbing then connects from the base of the toe disc on the third digit to the distal end of the antepenultimate digit on the fourth digit, and terminates at the toe disc on the fifth digit. The hind foot also has a thin tarsal fold that runs the full length of the tarsus (Duellman 1970).

Hatchling tadpoles can range from 6.72 to 7.47 mm long in total length (Gonzalez et al. 2011). Tadpoles at developmental stage 36 average 29 mm in total length (Savage 2002). The tadpoles have a blunt snout, small dorsolateral nostrils, and laterally directed eyes (Duellman 1970). The body is violin-shaped (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013) or ovoid with a sinistral spiracle. The small mouth is terminal (Duellman 1970) and has finely serrated upper and lower beaks, though no denticles (Savage 2002). The tail is long with a thin flagellum at the end (Savage 2002) and high fins (Duellman 1970). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus is one of at least 97 species in the genus Dendropsophus and is placed within the group of leaf-gluing frogs that includes at least eight other species. Dendropsophus ebraccatus is the only species of the nine that is trans-Andean; the other eight species are cis-Andean.  Dendropsophus ebraccatus can be differentiated from similar species by the bands that are usually on the upper side of its dorsum. Dendropsophus ebraccatus has abnormal bands that are disrupted by brown smudges, while its close relatives D. manonergra and D. triangulum have a more consistent pattern. Dendropsophus manonergra does not have disruptions within its bands while D. triangulum has a consistent disruption, if present. Dendropsophus manonergra, D. roassalleni,  and D. sarayacuensis have triangle shaped blotches between both of their eyes (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013). Dendropsophus ebraccatus is also commonly confused with D. phlebodes and D. microcephala. Both of the latter species lack the hourglass pattern on the dorsum, allowing for easy differentiation when the D. ebraccatus individual has this distinctive pattern. When the hourglass pattern is absent on an individual, D. ebraccatus can be distinguished from both D. microcephala and D. phlebodes by its dark eye mask and pale lip stripe (Leenders 2016), as well as its finger webbing, which is more extensive than the other two species (Savage 2002). Dendropsophus phlebodes also has a grey tint to its dorsum coloration, whereas D. ebraccatus is brightly colored (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). Dendropsophus ebraccatus can be further differentiated from D. microcephala and D. phlebodes by its long primary calling notes. These three species have different pulse rates in their callings, with D. ebraccatus having the slowest pulse rate (Savage 2002). In addition, D. microcephala callings are much higher in frequency than D. ebraccatus (Wilczynski et al. 1993). 

In life, D. ebraccatus usually has a yellow dorsum with golden-brown blotches forming the shape of an hourglass, giving it the common name ‚Äúhourglass treefrog.‚Äù The dark blotches are sometimes bordered by lighter colors, such as bright yellow, cream, or white (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). While the hourglass pattern is most common, there are 10 different pattern variants that range in the extent of the dark blotches, from completely tan-yellow with no blotches to the actual hourglass-shaped pigmentation (Ohmer et al. 2009). Dendropsophus ebraccatus also has a dark brown eye mask extending as a stripe past the eye and covering the tympanum. Beneath this dark eye mask they often have a pale lip stripe that expands below the eye to form a light spot (Leenders 2016). Dendropsophus ebraccatus generally have banded limbs, with the same coloring as their dorsum (Leenders 2001). The thighs are uniformly bright yellow or orange on both the dorsal and ventral sides (Leenders 2016). The fingers generally have no color (Cope 1874). The iris varies in color from a pale yellow or tan to a dark brownish-red (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). 

In life, tadpoles have a brown to black dorsum with brightly colored blotches, and a pale ventrum (Savage 2002). The blotches are red, gold, white, or any combination of the three colors (Guyer and Donnelly 2005). The tail is primarily gold with black barring, and the fins are generally red with black barring (Savage 2002). There is a pigmented spot on the tail that varies in color and size depending on the predators in their environment (Touchon and Warkentin 2008 Oikos).  The iris is red and bronze (Savage 2002). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus lives in a range of elevations. One study shows that D. ebraccatus‚Äô body size throughout all stages of growth correlates with the elevation a population is living at, with populations living at higher elevations (greater than 300 m) in Pacific versant populations being larger than those at lower elevations. The same study also showed that populations on the Pacific side of the Cordillera de Talamanca mountain range have larger body sizes. In addition, there are roughly ten different color variations (Ohmer et al. 2009). The patterning on the dorsum ranges from a clear hourglass shape with or without additional spots surrounding it to a solid yellow dorsum with no blotches, and spans all coloring in between (Savage 2002). Dendropsophus ebraccatus females are slightly larger than males, and males have an easily discernible vocal patch (Guyer and Donnelly 2005).

","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus lives in Central America from southern Mexico to Ecuador (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010) at elevational ranges of 0 - 1600 m. Populations are isolated in some areas by the mountain range, Cordillera de Talamanca (Ohmer et al. 2009), and are not as prevalent in Ecuador (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010). Dendropsophus ebraccatus is most commonly found in humid lowland forests (Leenders 2016), but they have also been found in habitat edges, orchards, pastures, and secondary vegetation indicating a tolerance of human disturbances. Dendropsophus ebraccatus is typically found on vegetation that hangs above both permanent and temporary pools of water (Matias and Escalante 2015). 
","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus is a nocturnal, arboreal frog that is abundant throughout its range (Gonzalez et al 2011). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus has been found to cohabitate with closely related frogs that utilize the same spatial and food resources. The species preys on terrestrial invertebrates and has been found to have little to no competition with its close relative D. phlebodes, the San Carlos treefrog. Due to D. ebraccatus‚Äô larger size, it eats larger prey animals while D. phlebodes eats smaller invertebrates. Regardless of the predation distribution, empty frog stomachs in the field provide evidence that the majority of their time is allocated to calling. These males have overlapping breeding grounds that are utilized to find mates. It is believed that these frogs can coexist due to the heterogeneity in the environment; they have been found to use various types of foliage with differing heights to call for females, which allows for perch height segregation (Jim√©nez and Bolainos 2012).

Dendropsophus ebraccatus mate from May to November, when its surrounding environment is at its wettest (Ohmer et al. 2009). Hoping to attract a female, males call from 15 cm to 2 m (Miyamoto and Cane 1980 Copiea) above ponds created during the rainy season (Ohmer et al. 2009). Males produce multiple types of calls including defensive and aggressive calls, which they use to compete with males of their own species and neighboring heterospecifics, as well as advertisement calls (Savage 2002). The different types of calls have different pitches. High pitch calls are used for intrasexual competition. However, females show preference for low pitches over high pitches (Reichert 2011). 

Advertisement calls are composed of buzz-like introductory notes that may be followed a click-like secondary notes or aggressive calls depending on if they are calling alone or in response to other males. Lone males often only call with the first note. The duration of advertisement calls is between 96 ‚Äì 240 ms, with a pulse rate of 85 - 110 pulses per second and with 54 ‚Äì 92% of the call spent rising in amplitued. The dominate frequency is around 3 kHz (Wells and Schwartz 1984). Females prefer a swifter call rate that includes multiple notes, rather than a single note (Vitt and Caldwell 2009).

Aggressive calls are more variable but are generally longer (120 ‚Äì 664 ms) than adveritsement calls, have a higher pulse repetition rate (157 ‚Äì 461 pulses per second) and may include secondary click notes. The proportion of call time spent rising in amplitued also has a greater variation of 11 ‚Äì 93%.  The dominate frequency, like the advertisement call, is around 3 kHz (Wells and Schwartz 1984). 

Males increase the aggressiveness in their calls when other males are nearby (Reichert 2011). When males are further from each other they have shorter introductory notes which increase in length as distance between males decreases.  Additionally, pulse rate is positively correlated to an aggressive response from other males and rising time appears to be an important feature when pulse rates were high (Wells and Schwartz 1984). 

Males call throughout the night while staying in a vegetative pond area (Touchon and Worley 2015). Non-calling, sneaker, males are also present and position themselves in the space between the calling males and the females. From this position, the silent males remain still so when an allured female makes her way to the calling male he can attempt to mate with her (Miyamoto and Cane 1980 Biotropica).

Advertising males call faster as females approach them until the female rotates her body toward the male, at which point he stops calling (Savage 2002). Males position themselves on the females via axillary amplexus (Miyamoto and Cane 1980 Copiea). After external fertilization, a female can lay around 180 to 300 eggs in one night (Touchon and Worley 2015). Females are capable of ovipositing on both land and water. The terrestrial eggs are commonly placed above the water on a plant to allow the tadpoles to fall into the water after hatching, while aquatic eggs are place beneath the surface on vegetation. Their decision of placement depends on environmental cues rather than genetics. For example, less shaded regions would influence the female to oviposit aquatically rather than terrestrially to decrease chances of desiccation (Touchon and Warkentin 2008 PNAS). If aquatic predators are present, D. ebraccatus will lay eggs in overlying vegetation and risk desiccation. Eggs oviposited in the water are able to hatch after forty hours ; the developmental rate for terrestrial eggs is much slower  (Touchon and Worley 2015). 

In order for the species to oviposit on both land and water, the eggs must be able to withstand the either environment. While most amphibians begin releasing a hatching enzyme right before they hatch,D. ebraccatus gradually releases the enzyme as the embryo develops and the vitelline membrane slowly degrades. This process accelerates hatching, enables the tadpole to avoid threats such as predation or desiccation, and allows offspring to take the best course of action for survival (Cohen et al. 2018). 

Tadpoles graze the shallow waters for algae (Gonzalez et al. 2011), generally hiding in clumps of vegetation (Leenders 2001). One study showed how the presence of dragonflies causes tadpoles to develop a redder pigment on their tail and a larger tail in comparison to the presence of fish, which causes tadpoles to grow smaller tails. These different responses in tail morphology may be evolutionary adaptations to avoid predators. The red spot and large tails on tadpoles subjected to dragonflies may be deterring dragonflies from eating them while the small tails may help propel tadpoles away from fish (Touchon and Warkentin 2008 Oikos). The tadpoles metamorphose into frogs four to six weeks after hatching (Savage 2002).

Adult variation in dorsal patterning is explained by both regional genetic drift and environmental pressures. The purpose for the bright coloration in D. ebraccatus is unknown; it is possible the color and patterns are a form of aposematism or a form of crypsis. The toxicity of the poison glands are unknown, and due to the broad range of endemicity, it is difficult to determine the selection pressures acting on the coloration of the species. There is some indication that the variation and frequency in coloration is not due to sexual selection, but rather natural selection (Ohmer et al. 2009).
 
Dendropsophus ebraccatus is highly susceptible to predation and parasitism (Touchon and Warkertin 2008 PNAS). In one study, individuals were found to host the nematode parasite Cosmocerca parva. However, there is no indication that this parasite has a major effect on the species population (Bursey and Brooks 2010). In addition to parasites, large aquatic invertebrates-such as dragonfly larvae and water bugs- and fish have been seen to regularly prey on D. ebraccatus eggs (Touchon and Warketin 2008 PNAS). 

When aquatic predators are abundant, D. ebraccatus may lay eggs terrestrially to increase the chances of egg survival (Cohen et al. 2018). Terrestrially lain eggs are subject to predation by spiders, wasps, and ants (Touchon and Warketin 2008 PNAS).

","

","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus‚Äô population trend is stable, and is listed as ‚ÄúLeast Concern‚Äù on the IUCN Red List. The hourglass treefrog is an adaptable species that has thus far not been impacted by human disturbances (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010). The ability of females to oviposit on both land and water allows reproduction to be flexible. However, changes in the amount of rainfall due to climate change could make terrestrial egg deposits more susceptible to desiccation (Touchon and Worley 2015). While the environment could lead to egg desiccation, deforestation and contamination from pesticides associated with farming could affect adults because the species is primarily forest dwellers. However, the flexibility of D. ebraccatus' life history allows some populations to live in unforested areas (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010), including parks and agricultural lands (Leenders 2016). However, it was found that the mean size and age was decreased in areas of high human disturbance. It is possible that the difference in size is due to lowered life expectancy; no limb asymmetry was found. (Matias and Escalante 2015).

The presence of chytridiomycosis in D. ebraccatus is low. When scientists examined if the root of the low frequency could be due to differences in the environment or differences in their microbiota, it was found that the microbiota of Panamanian treefrogs is in fact different from other frogs, but no conclusive evidence linked the differing microflora to the low rates of chytridiomycosis (Belden et al. 2015).

","
Dendropsophus ebraccatus is used for research purposes with special interest surrounding its rapid hatch rate and its ability to oviposit both terrestrially and aquatically, which is found only in a few species. In addition to the research interest, these animals are kept as pets (Karl-Heinz et al. 2010) and used as attractions for ecotourism sites in Central America (Spangler 2015).

Dendropsophus ebraccatus is a frog in the family Hylidae. In 2005, D. ebraccatus was moved from the genus Hyla to the genus Dendropsophus in accordance with its molecular evidence. The genus Dendropsophus was resurrected to encompass many species that were moved from Hyla due to shared characteristics of mitochondrial evidence and pectoral glands in males and females (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

Dendropsophus ebraccatus is part of the D. leucophyllatus species group. Based on Maximum Parsimony analysis of 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and tRNA Valine genes, D. ebraccatus is sister to the clade composed of D. bifurcus, D. leucophyllatus, D. manoegra, D. saryacuensis, and D. triangulum (Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013). This analysis supports an earlier Baysian and Maximum Likelihood analysis of 808 base pairs of 12S and 16S rRNA, which had lower confidence scores (Fouquet et al. 2011). Both studies indicate that the clade including D. ebraccatus is sister to a clade including D. salli and D. elegans but disagree on the placement of D. miyatai in relation to D. ebraccatus (Fouquet et al. 2011, Rivera-Correa and Orrico 2013).

The species epithet, ebraccatus is latin for ‚Äúwithout trousers‚Äù (Smithsonian Tropical Institute: Amphibians of Panama, accessed 2018); the name is thought to reference the lack of patterning on the species‚Äô thighs (Leenders 2001).  

Dendropsophus ebraccatus was first named Hyla ebraccata in 1874 (Cope 1874). In 1954, its name was changed to Hyla weyerae. In 2005, the species was changed from the genus Hyla to the genus Dendropsophus, which gave rise to the scientific name used today, Dendropsophus ebraccatus (Faivovich et al. 2005). 

Dendropsophus ebraccata has 30 diploid chromosomes, or a karyotype of 2n = 30 (Savage 2002).

Cardoso and Haddad (1984) discussed geographically coherent acoustic differences among populations. Kaplan (1994) suggested that Dendropsophus minutus is a complex of species. The general diagnosis is: head short, snout rounded; dorsum orange, brown or tan, usually with a pair of dorso-lateral stripes that can be simple or elaborate. Belly whitish. Throat yellow in males and white in females. Coloured thighs, mainly in the females. Tympanum indistinct (Cei 1980; Kwet 1999; Bastos 2003).
","
D. minutus has a widespread distribution from the lowlands east of the Andes from Colombia, Venezuela, and Trinidad southward through Ecuador, Peru and Brazil to Bolivia, Uruguay, until Argentina, up to 2000 m elevation (Frost 2004). This species may be considered very versatile, according to its wide range in latitude as well as in altitude (Cei 1980). It is an arboreal species but during breeding time it is commonly found in open grasslands near shallow waters.
","
Hemipterans and Aranaea are important components of the diet of D. minutus, but individuals of Homoptera and Diptera can also be part of the diet (Sluys & Rocha 1998). 

Males usually call from grass, emergent aquatic plants, or low shrubs next to the water. Their short, shrill calls produce loud mass concerts, heard from dusk until after midnight (Kwet 1999). Kwet (2001) registered a dominant frequency  of 3600-5800 Hz, and 4040-4840 Hz as maximum. Two mating strategies have been reported: the calling male and the satellite male (Haddad 1991). Territorial disputes were observed by Cardoso & Haddad (1984); different calls and physical combat behavior to defend calling sites have been observed by Haddad (1987). The amplexus is axilar. Egg-laying occurs in standing water bodies, such as ponds or large puddles. Spawning period from September to February (Kwet 1999). 
","
The larval morphology was studied by Vizotto (1967) and the microanatomy of the buccal apparatus and oral cavity were described by Echeverria (1997).  The tadpole is characterized by its high orange and black coloured tail fin and a dark line ranging from snout to eye. It is free-swimming and feeds mainly on algae (Kwet 1999). Tadpoles raised in laboratory were observed to feed on commercial fish food and plant material. Peixoto (1997) suggested that tadpoles of D. minutus could be facultatively carnivorous. 
","

","

","
Dendrosophus brevifrons differs by having a white horizontal bar below the eyes, and a brown dorsum without hourglass markings.

This species was previously within the genus Hyla but has recently been moved to the resurrected genus Dendropsophus (Faivovich et al. 2005). It is likely a complex of several species.

This species was featured as News of the Week on December 15, 2014.
An emerging biodiversity pattern is that of single amphibian species that are widespread across a continent are found to be complexes of several cryptic species. These are species that are difficult to distinguish without detailed analysis of traits such as mating calls in frogs or DNA sequences. An extreme example is the species Dendropsophus minutus, which extends over several ecoregions, including the wet forests of Amazonia, the coastal Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil, to dry scrub forest of the Caatinga. Depending on the region, the species occurs from sea level to 2000 m asl. Using mtDNA sequences, Gehara and 29 co-authors (2014) identified 43 lineages within the single ""species,"" many of which may represent cryptic species. The distribution of one lineage covers more than 1 million km2. This broad-brush study is an important first step in documenting taxonomic and biogeographic patterns of Neotropical biodiversity that beg for deeper analysis (Written by David Cannatella). 

This species was featured in News of the Week 14 August 2023:
Amphibians are found across a wide range of elevations, from sea level to above 5,000 meters, exposing them to a wide range of climates. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that organisms exposed to more temperate variation will be able to function across a wider range of temperatures. Bovo et al. (2023) tested the thermal tolerances of five species of frogs that are distributed across mountains in Brazil's Atlantic Rainforest. They found differences among species in temperature tolerance, but did not always find that broader temperature variation at increasing elevations correlated with broader temperature tolerance. In addition, they did not find a consistent difference in water loss or water uptake across altitude or climates. Overall, they did not find strong support for the climate variability hypothesis or for elevation shaping these physiological traits. (MWomack)

Dendropsophus werneri is a small species whose females measure up to 22 to 23 mm in SVL. Males are typically smaller in length, 18 to 20 mm (Lutz 1973). The head is short with large protuberant eyes. The snout is short and rounded, but juts out slightly in cross-section. The canthus rostralis is distinct. The tympanum is visible, and is about two-fifths the diameter of the eye. Vomerine teeth are present in two small groups located between the choanae  
(Lutz 1973). Both fingers and toes are webbed.  Webbing between fingers is approximately one-third the length of the digits, and the webbing between toes is approximately three-fourths to almost the entire length  
(Duellman 1970; Lutz 1973). Hind limbs are relatively short. There are no dermal folds on the limbs, but they do possess an axillary membrane.  The ends of D. werneri digits terminate in expanded discs. Males have a small ridge on the outside of their first finger, though they lack nuptial pads. Males have single large median subgular vocal sacs. The dorsal skin texture is smooth with occasional pustules. The ventral skin and lower median area of the thighs are granular  
(Lutz 1973).   
 
The dorsum is generally cream to tawny in color with small brown aggregated markings. Some individuals have a grayish red dorsal surface and a rosy ventral surface with a yellow belly. Dorsal markings can occur in an elongated X-shaped pattern, or the entire dorsal surface may be covered with dark spots, or it may be nearly devoid of pattern, which is typical for pale specimens.  The sides of the head have a dark patch, and dark patches of dots are usually present on the knee and elbow. The visible portion of the thigh has short bars, while the concealed part of the thighs lacks patterning. Many individuals have vivid white spots below each eye, or occasionally under only one eye (Lutz 1973).    
 
The tadpoles have tails that narrow sharply into a flagellum-like appendage (Duellman 1970).
","
Dendropsophus werneri is common in southern and southeastern Brazil.  It is mostly located in lowlands but can be found up to 800 m above sea level. Its habitat is limited to areas of vegetation near bodies of water 
(Andrade et al. 2004).
","
This species is found near bodies of water, including flooded areas and abandoned agricultural fields. It can be located on the perimeter of forests during breeding season, but usually stays away from the interior of the forest. It tends to favor semi-permanent bodies of water, such as swamps, for breeding 
(Andrade et al. 2004). 
 
Dendropsophus werneri is a member of the Dendropsophus microcephalus group, which are known to breed in flooded areas during periods of high precipitation. Males of this group prefer to make their mating calls in low vegetation, such as grass or bushes. Eggs are laid on the water‚Äôs surface in small clusters, typically attached to aquatic-growing plants. In Brazil, adult members of this group are most commonly a form of arboreal species, but do not venture very high in trees when they do climb. Lutz 
 (1973) found male D. werneri sitting atop herbaceous vegetation.  Mating calls are reminiscent of an insect, occurring in a series: ""creek-eek-eek-eek."" The first sound is the primary note, followed in quick succession by repetitive secondary notes  
(Duellman 1970).  The call of D. werneri was observed to be very similar to that of D. meridianus (then referred to as Hyla misera meridiana)  
(Lutz 1973).
","

","
The species appears to be abundant (Andrade et al., 2004).[3900]
","

","
This species has undergone numerous name changes since it was first described in 1894 by Werner (1894)[4001] as Hyla pygmaea. It was later renamed after Werner as Hyla misera werneri  
(Cochran 1952). The name was changed to its current form, Dendropsophus werneri, in 2005  
(Faivovich et al. 2005).

Vomerine teeth present. Tongue more or less free posteriorly. Pupil of the eye horizontal. Toes webbed. Tips of fingers and toes expanded into discs. Tympanic membrane smaller than eye. When the hind leg is stretched along the body, the tibio-tarsal articulation commonly reaches the anterior edge of the eye. Dorsal skin smooth, ventral skin granular. Dorsal coloration varies from green to light-grey, brown, or almost black depending on substrate color and temperature. Coloration changes depending on substrate. No dark spot below the eye. Ventral surface white or yellowish. Dorsal surface divided from ventral surface by thin, dark, uninterrupted band with outer white edging. This band usually forms an inguinal loop, except for some individuals of H. arborea schelkownikowi. If the inguinal loop is absent, the dark band reaches the inner surface of the groin. A light line bordering lips. Male differs from female by having a large guttural vocal sac (visible externally) which is distinguished by darker skin folds and wrinkles on the throat.






","
The subspecies H. arborea arborea inhabits almost all of Europe. The northern margin of the range runs approximately from Denmark (Aarhus and Jutland), Sweden (Scania) and the southern shore of the Baltic Sea in Lithuania (Vilnius City: 54¬∫41'N, 25¬∫17'E) through Byelorussia (approximately on the line: towns of Oshmyany - Uzda - Slutsk) to southern Russia. From there, the margin runs south- and south-eastwards approximately along the line Bryansk Province - Kursk Province - west of Byelgorod Province (Shebekino District), then southwards in Ukraine from Kharkov City to Dnepropetrovsk Province to Donetsk Province. In Crimea, the frog is known from the southern shore and the extreme northwest of the peninsula. The frog is absent from eastern and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France. H. arborea schelkownikowi lives in the Caucasus. Its northern range runs in Russia approximately from Krasnodar Region along the line Abrau Peninsula in Novorossiik District - Goryachii Klyuch Town - Maikop Town - Stavropol Region (Stavropol City: 45¬∫03'N, 41¬∫59'E). From there, the margin runs in Stavropol Region to the south-east and then to the east: North Ossetia to Chechnya to Daghestan. The subspecies is absent in the highlands of the Great Caucasus. The eastern part of the southern margin of the range runs from the Northern Turkey to Georgia and Azerbaijan. The southern margin of the range is insufficiently known. H. arborea kretensis lives in Crete, Rhodos, Aegean, Peloponnese and the west of Asia Minor; H. arborea molleri in Northwestern Spain and Portugal; H. arborea sarda in Corsica, Sardinia and Elba. 
The Common Tree Frog inhabits well-illuminated, broad-leafed and mixed forests, bushlands, gardens, vineyards, orchards, parks, lake shores and stream banks. Dark and dense forests are avoided. Meadows are primarily used for reproduction. In the southern areas of the European part of the range, i.e. in the forest steppe zone, the tree frog inhabits insular forests and dense vegetation of floodplains. In mountains, it lives only in forests and in more or less wet transformed landscapes, and sometimes penetrates the subalpine belt. Spawning occurs in stagnant waters such as lakes, ponds, swamps and reservoirs, sometimes even in ditches and puddles.






","
In suitable habitats in the southern part of the range this is a common amphibian. For example, in the south of the former Soviet Union up to 20 specimens per 100 m of pond shore may be counted in spring. After reproduction, the population density is maximum in river valleys covered with broad-leafed trees.
During the day, H. arborea usually sit on the stems and broad leaves of trees, bushes and large herbaceous vegetation. The frog is active primarily in the evening and at night, when it comes down to the ground from vegetation to forage and to rehydrate. During the autumn migration to hibernacula, H. arborea are active during the day. Hibernation occurs on land from September - December to February - early May, on land (in soil, burrows, heaps of stones and holes in trees). Reproduction occurs from April - May, but sometimes in March, June or even late July. As a rule, more males are found in breeding pools than females. Females enter pools after males and leave immediately after breeding. Clutch contains about 200-2000 eggs deposited in portions, usually having the form of small rounded clumps containing from 3 to 100 eggs. Metamorphosis occurs from June to September, depending on the geographic position of a locality. In some cases, the larvae overwinter and complete transformation the following summer. Young froglets in the first time remain on the shore climbing grass and small bushes. Hyla arborea prey mainly on insects. Its ability for long leaps makes it possible to forage on fast flying insects, which comprise a considerable proportion of its food. The frogs forage on land. During the breeding season, adults forage periodically on the shore and on high plant stems above the water surface.






","

","
The tree frog displays a considerable decline and extinction in the West and Central Europe. It is caused by loss of breeding habitats, habitat isolation and fragmentation, pollution and collecting by people, as well as climate changes. However, in many large areas of its southern part of the range, e.g. in Ukraine and the Caucasus, the species is not rare and does not display population declines.






","
Although some kinds of human activity lead to decline and extinction of populations of H. arborea (see above), construction of a system of fish ponds, ditches, channels etc. sometimes cause local increase in the number of this species.






","
Protection of habitats seems to be the most important method of conservation of H. arborea.

Hyla meridionalis usually grows to 50 mm, with females up to 65mm in 
length. Slender, long-legged tree frog, with smooth skin. The head is broader than long.
 Adhesive discs on all digits, with those on the fingers being larger than on 
the toes. The back is mostly green, but a yellowish, gray, brown or spotted
 coloration also occurs. Color change is physiological. The venter is whitish.
 A dark stripe is present from the nostril across the eye and tympanum to the
 shoulder. The iris is brownish golden, the pupils are horizontal. 
The tympanum is clearly visible and about half the diameter of the eye. 
 Males posses a vocal sac which can be inflated to a size half the 
snout-vent length. At rest, the vocal sac is longitudinally folded and yellow
 to brownish in color. The throat of females is somewhat lighter than the
 venter. Taken from Noellert and Noellert (1992) and Bons and Beniez (1996). 







","
The general area occupied by H. meridionalis in Europe extends from
 S France and NW Italy, to S Portugal and Spain, including Menorca, in the
 Balearic Islands, and the Canary Islands. Its European range includes two main general groups of
 populations.  A southern group occupies S and W Spain and Portugal, and
 a northern group extends from NE Spain and S France to NW Italy.  The 
southern group occupies mainly Central and S Portugal and SW Spain; it is
 prolonged eastwards by three discontinuous groups of populations.  One
 group occurs along the Spanish Mediterranean coast from the provinces of
 Huelva and C√°diz to the region of Murcia.  The second group inhabits Sierra 
Morena on the southern slopes of the Central Plateau.  And the third group
 runs along the Tajo River, which acts as a corridor for the penetration of
 the western populations inside the Central Plateau, across the provinces
 of Toledo and Avila.  The northern group of populations is separated from
 the southern one by a long gap across the E Spanish Mediterranean coast 
from Murcia to Catalu√±a.  This group shows populations in the eastern 
portions of Catalu√±a in NE Spain, in a wide area of S France, and across
 the Liguria region to the province of Genova in NW Italy.  The populations
 from S France are widely spread along the Mediterranean coast, running 
along the Rh√¥ne Valley as far as the Dr6me, and along the southeastern 
slopes of the Massif Central as far as the northwestern portions of the 
Charente-Maritime d√©partement.  Some isolated populations have been reported
 from the south of the Landes region, in the d√©partement of 
Pyren√©es-Atlantiques in France and in the Basque Country in Spain.
 H. meridionalis is also present in the Balearic Archipelago
 but restricted to Menorca Island, where it occurs throughout the island.
 Little is known of the northern limits of the range.  In Iberia its
 distribution seems to be limited by the cold and dry regions of the
 Central Plateau, but the northwestern and eastern limits along the 
coasts are uncertain.  There is no actual continuity between the 
populations of the northern Mediterranean coast and the southern
 Mediterranean ones.  The northern and the southwestern limits of its
 distribution in France are uncertain. H. meridionalis is usually
 found at low altitudes, from sea level up to 450 m in Portugal and 650m 
in France.  Exceptionally it can exceed 1000 m in NE Spain (Montseny, 
province of Barcelona), and S France (Gasc 1997).
H. meridionalis also occurs in NW Africa. Here it occurs in 
the humid Mediterranean regions of the Mahgreb. In Morocco it occurs
 in the Moyen et Haut Atlas. It is found up to an altitude of 2650 m 
in Oukaimedene in the Haut Atlas (Schleich et al. 1996).
 A morphologically
 different form is found in the Anti Atlas Mountains the southernmost 
part of the range of the species (Bons and Beniez 1996). 








","
Mating occurs in March and April in North Africa, while the European 
populations mate from April to June (France) or from December to January 
(Portugal). Males call from water as well as from land and trees. The
 individual call is a deep, resonant ""Cra-a-ar"", repeated not much faster
 than every second and typically much slower (Burton and Arnold 1978).
 Calling can also occur in duo's, trio's or choruses, and is sometimes
 deafening. Calling can be heard from kilometers away during the calling 
peak in the breeding season. Amplexus lasts several hours to some days. 
Fleeing reactions are greatly reduced in mated couples. For oviposition 
they prefer plant accumulations near the shore. The female searches an 
object to attach her eggs to and expulses some spawn. This is the signal 
for the male to dip his hindbody down and inseminate the eggs. Oviposition
is repeated at many places until the female has no more eggs to expel. Even
 then she continues to act as before, but when the male notes that there 
are no more eggs he quits. When breeding is finalized the frogs leave the 
vicinity of the water and move away into trees etc. where they call mainly 
during the afternoon or evening hours until aestivation begins. 
The eggs are 800-1000 in number, deposited in lumps of 10-30 each, mostly 
on plants, but some sink to the bottom. Ovum diameter is 1.1 to 1.5mm, with
 a gelatinous envelope of 3-5mm. Tadpoles hatch after 8-10 days with a total
 length of 5-8mm. The tadpoles have high fins relative to their total length.
 They grow up to 4cm, with a maximum of 5.5cm. Metamorphosis occurs 3-4 months
 after hatching. The diet consists of various arthropods like spiders, bugs,
 beetles, butterflies, flies and ants, which are caught from ambush by day
 and by foraging at night (Schleich et al. 1996).








","

","
The main areas of distribution of the species in SW Iberia and S France seem
 to maintain a relatively high number of populations, although the rapid 
destruction of breeding biotopes and the intense use of pesticides, both
 a consequence of the loss of traditional agricultural methods, could 
modify the present situation in a short period of time. The populations 
of the southeastern Mediterranean coast and the isolated populations in 
the Basque Country could be considered the most endangered populations 
in Spain. The latter, limited to a few ponds in sandy soil, have recently 
been recorded again, but the possibilities of continuity appear to be very low
 (Gasc 1997). 
Honnegger (1981) notes that the species is suffering 
from an intensive anti-mosquito campaign along the Mediterranean coast.

","
Lysapsus limellum is a small Hylid frog with a snout-vent length range of 15 - 24 mm (Kehr and Basso 1990, Garda et al. 2007). Females are significantly larger than males, having snout-vent ranges of 16.2 - 24.8 mm, while the male snout-vent range is 15.3 ‚Äì 21.0 mm (Garda et al. 2010). The head is as wide as the body (Cope 1862). However, the head is small with large protruding eyes and a pointed snout (Garda and Cannatella 2007, Garda et al. 2010). There is no canthus rostrilis and the nostrils are vertical. The eye is twice the size of the tympanic disc (Cope 1862). It has relatively short forelimbs and long muscular hindlimbs (Garda and Cannatella 2007). All of the digits have a broad palmate appearance (Cope 1862). The humerus is shorter than the lower arm. The hands are short and not webbed (Goldberg and Fabrezi 2008). The base of the phalanges is thick. The smooth palms are not tubercular but have an acute cuneiforme tubercle at the base of finger I. Finger IV is longer than III (Cope 1862). Its hindlimbs have long, completely webbed feet well-suited for swimming (Goldberg and Fabrezi 2008). When appressed, the knee reaches the tympanum. The tibia is more than twice as long as the tarsus (Cope 1862). It has finely granulated skin on both the dorsal and ventral sides of its body (Garda and Cannatella 2007, Garda et al. 2010) except in the middle of the thorax. With the exception of the posterior surface of the tarsus, there are no dermal folds (Cope 1986).

Like most Lysapsus frogs, L. limellum exhibits a ‚Äúparadoxical‚Äù life history, with its tadpoles being significantly larger than its adult frogs. Lysapsus limellum tadpoles can reach up to about 40 mm in total length (body and tail) and 11 mm in body length. Tadpoles have terminal oral discs directed forward. A large portion of the middle of the anterior labia lacks papillae, while the rest of the labia are fringed by one or two rows of papillae. The tadpole‚Äôs upper and lower jaws are serrated and 50% keratinized. Their tails are much longer than their body (Kehr and Basso 1990).

Lysapsus limellum is differentiated from L. laevis by the presence of small pointed tubercules on both the ventral and dorsal skin of the body, giving it granulated skin. Without the use of genetic sequencing, L. limellum is only differentiated from L. caraya by its habitat range: while L. limellum is found in the Amazon and Paran√° Basins, L. caraya is found in the Araguaia River basin. Lysapsus limellum can be distinguished from all frogs in the genus Pseudis by the presence of inner and outer metatarsal tubercles (small rounded nodules on the hindfoot) rather than only an inner metatarsal tubercle (Garda et al. 2010).

In life, L. limellum shows a variety of colors from pale green to a dark brown-green. While individual frogs may show patterns of spots or stripes, there is no species-specific pattern common to all L. limellum frogs (Garda et al. 2010). The eyes are golden (Kehr and Basso 1990).

Cope (1862) described the species, presumable in preservative, as having a dark reddish brown coloration with a dark spot on the back of the head. There were two sets of narrow yellowish lines along the side of the frog, one starting at the eye and the other starting at the tympanum. An additional light-colored line connected the corner of the mouth to the eye. There were broad transverse bands across the femur (2) and tibia (3). There was an additional broad brown band extending from the back of the knee to the cloacal region. The ventrum is rust colored and there are small brown spots on the lower labial area. 

The tadpoles are green in life and a greyish brown with spots in preservative. Tails in older tadpoles have a distinctive black tip, which may confuse predators and encourage them to attack the tail rather than the body (Kehr and Basso 1990).



","
Lysapsus limellum is found in the Paran√° River and Amazon River Basins, specifically in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay (Gallardo 1961) and Uruguay (Lavilla et al. 2004). It is typically pond-dwelling and widely distributed, with populations most often found in areas that are either near or in savannas or along large rivers (da Silva and Bates 2002). These areas all have high availability of water and low to no tree cover, prompting speculation that L. limellum prefers ponds in open floodplains. Within bodies of water, it is known to prefer areas of mostly open water, with floating vegetation rather than rooted aquatic vegetation. It is distributed across a wide area and so can be found at a wide range of altitudes, but is never found above 800 m above sea level (Garda et al. 2007).
","
Lysapsus limellum courts and breeds continuously throughout the year rather than having a breeding season (Prado and Uetanabaro 2000). Males sit atop floating vegetation while calling to females (H√∂dl 1977). They call during both the day and night, but are more active and call less during the day while at night they are stationary and call more. Males exhibit two known calls. The first, likely an advertisement call, is 0.12 to 0.34 seconds long and composed of 6 - 12 pulses between 3703 to 5599 Hz. The second is likely a social call, composed of two notes, which has been quantified in other species of Lysapsus but not in L. limellum (Santana et al. 2013). 

They lay clutches of 10 - 182 eggs (Garda et al. 2007).

The black tails tips in older tadpoles may confuse predators and encourage them to attack the tail rather than the body. Tadpoles live in midwater within ponds, staying within patches of aquatic vegetation. They are preyed upon by aquatic insects (Kehr and Basso 1990).

Lysapsus limellum is a generalist forager, feeding on dipterans, odonates, and mites. It is currently unknown whether it is an active, passive, or intermediate forager, or what time of the day most foraging occurs. As noted above it is most active during the day, and has been observed jumping on the water surface and then diving underwater to avoid threats. They are preyed upon by fish and large invertebrates (Garda et al. 2007). 

","

","
Because L. limellum is widely distributed and has large populations in the areas where it is found, it is not considered a threatened species (Prado and Uetanabaro 2000, Garda et al. 2010). Currently there are no known threats (Lavilla et al. 2004).

The species authority is: Cope, E. D. (1862). ‚ÄúOn some new and little known American Anura.‚Äù Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 14, 151‚Äì159.

Based on Parsimonious and Maximum Likelihood analyses along with Baysian Inference of 2377 base pairs of combined 12S and 16S rRNA, L. limellum is sister to L. caraya. The clade of consisting of L. limellum and L. caraya is sister to L. laevis. The genus Lysapsus as a whole is sister to Pseudis (excepting Pseudis minuta and P. cardosoi) (Garda and Cannatella 2007, Aguiar Jr. et al. 2007). Lysapsus and Pseudis make up the Pseudae group, a rankless clade within the family Hylidae (Garda and Canatella 2007).

Two subspecies of L. limellum, L. limellum limellum and L. limellum bolivianus sensu, were reported by Gallardo in 1961 and are generally accepted (Gallardo 1961, Garda and Cannatella 2007).

Lysapsus limellum is incorrectly referred to in some literature as Lysapsis limellus due to a mis-citation of the original species account from Cope (1862). It is also referred to in some literature as Pseudis limellum due to controversy over the phylogeny of the Pseudae group (Garda et al. 2007).

Supratympanic fold distinct only from posterior edge of tympanum to sholder. Vocal sac is subgular or absent. Nostrils at the tip of snouts, placed laterally and directed backward. Finger discs distinct. Fingers free, webbing absent. Finger subarticular tubercles moderately developed. Nuptial pad is present in males, on inner side of the first finger. Forearm fold distinct, glandular, not scalloped. Subarticular tubercles presents. General dorsal texture smooth-glandular; throat and chest weakly glandular; belly glandular. Toe discs distinct. Inner metatarsal tubercle ovoid; heel with small calcar.  Dorsal color pattern bright green, but can vary depending on the day time, to brown or redbrick, with scattered small white spots. Concealed surface of sides, arms, legs, finger and toes orange or yellowish with irregular rounded purple or red chocolate spots. 
This species shows some sexual size dimorphism, with males being lighter and smaller than females (Bokermann 1966; Heyer et al. 1990). Cruz (1990) described the cranial osteology of a closely related species, P. guttata. 

The tadpole was described by Bokermann (1966), Cruz (1982) and Heyer et al. (1990): LTRF 1/2(1) or 0/1(1). Total length 43 mm at Gosner stage 36. Body sub-cylindrical in dorsal view and triangular in lateral view. Snout broad in dorsal outline. Eyes dorsolateral, laterally directed. Nares dorsolateral, small and rounded. Spiracle ventral, with elliptical opening, directed posteriorly. Vent tube long and dextral, not fused with the fin. Tail slightly higher than body. Dorsal fin originates at the posterior third of the body. Dorsal and ventral fins arched.  Oral apparatus anteroventral, with a semicircular funnel-shaped dermal fold superiorly bilobed, showing two distinct sizes of papillae. Jaw sheaths moderately developed and finely serrated, upper jaw sheath V-shaped. Caudal muscle reaching tail tip. General coloration gray-brownish, fins transparent, with flecks (Altig and McDiarmid 1999).

Phasmahyla cochranae is found in Brazil, within eastern Minas Gerais, Southwestern Rio de Janeiro and eastern S√£o Paulo states.  It occurs along forest streams associated with the Atlantic Rainforest at elevations up to 800 m asl. 
","
Phasmahyla cochranae lives along riparian vegetation of forest streams (Ribeiro et al. 2005). It is commonly found at very low abundance, usually no more than 3 individuals in a chorus (Heyer et al. 1990), it occurs from October to April (Cardoso et al. 1989). The eggs are deposited in a gelatinous mass inside envelopes of folded leaves over swift streams; hatchling tadpoles drop into the currents and drift downstream to deeper and quieter pools along montane streams, where frequently they form schools near the water surface at night (Bokermann 1966; Haddad and Sazima 1992, reproductive mode 25 of Haddad and Prado 2005). The development takes about 5 months (Bertoluci 1997; Provete pers. obs.). The mean number of eggs in the clutch is 32, the general color is cream white (Bokermann 1966; Haddad 1991). 
Tadpoles of this species are neustonic and forage at the water surface (Altig and McDiarmid 1999). The tadpoles are found with highest abundance between September and December (Bertoluci 1997). During the day they take refuge under stones, logs and other debris (Bokermann 1966).

Its range is within protected areas, like the Parque Estadual Nova Baden, Parque Estadual de Ibitipoca, in the state of Minas Gerais, and Parque Nacional da Serra da Bocaina, Parque Municipal do Itapetinga, Serra do Japi and, Esta√ß√£o Biol√≥gica de Borac√©ia, in the state of S√£o Paulo, and in Parque Nacional de Itatiaia, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Decreasing according to IUCN (2008). 
","

","
The diploid number is equal to 26 (Duellman 1968). 
The genus is named in reference to the typical walking, resembling that of the insects of the order Phasmatodea (Cruz 1990). The specific epithet cochranae is in homage to Dr. Doris. M. Cochran (USNM) (Bokermann 1966). D¬¥heursel (2004) described the internal oral features of the larva of this species.

Phyllomedusa bicolor is a large, arboreal frog (Boulenger 1882; Lima et al. 2005; Mota et al. 2020). Females range from 111 - 119 mm in snout-vent length, while males range from 91 - 113 mm (Lima et al. 2005; Ven√¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010). A truncated snout can be observed in addition to an oblique loreal region. The diameter of the eye is shorter than the snout and bigger than the tympanum. The interorbital space is greater than the upper eyelid (Boulenger 1882).  There is a distinct parotoid gland observable from behind the eye and over the tympanum (Boulenger 1882; Lacombe et al. 2000; Lima et al. 2005). Skin covers the tympanic membrane (Wagler 1830). 

The fingers are free, and the second and third are larger than the first and fourth respectively; the disks of the fingers are flat and similar in size to the tympanum (Wagler 1830; Boulenger 1882). An inner metatarsal tubercle is faint. When the hind limb is adpressed along the body, the tibio-tarsal articulation reaches the shoulder or tympanum. The toes are also free, with the first and second being equal in length, and with smaller disks than the fingers (Boulenger 1882). 

Bony deposits stud the upper surface of P. bicolor and granulations that are visible ventrally and at the lower surface of the thighs (Boulenger 1882). Lipid glands appear in the dorsal and dorsolateral regions, mucous glands appear in ventral surface skin, and serous glands appear all over the body (Lacombe et al. 2000).

Pinto et al. (2013) determined that metamorphosed froglets at Stage 46 have a snout-vent ranging from 21.34 - 22.81 mm. 

Phyllomedusa bicolor can be differentiated from other species by coloration. Specifically P. bicolor has dark gray irises and purplish/brown fingers with blue/green discs, while P. tarsius has red-orange irises with black reticulations and white-tipped, brown first and second fingers. Such coloration also contrasts to P. vaillanti, which has silvery-gray irises and orange or dark purple discs on the fingers. Furthermore, P. bicolor has blue-green bellies and purple-edged, white spots on their sides, while P. vaillanti has purple bellies and sides (Lima et al. 2005).

It is unclear whether the following coloration description is in life or preservative. The dorsum of  P. bicolor is blue-green, while the ventrum ranges from purplish-white, cream, or yellow-white. Small, purple-edged, white spots are visible laterally along the body and limbs, more dense on the flank and hind legs. Similar spots are also on the chest and lower lips. A narrow line of similar coloration to such spots runs along the outer side of the forearms and tarsus. The fingers themselves are either purplish or brown with blue or green discs. Phyllomedusa bicolor also has dark gray irises (Boulenger 1882; Lima et al. 2005). 

At the froglet stage, froglets are green, with sparse, darkly-outlined, and white spots on the chest and hind legs (Pinto et al. 2013).

Regarding size, males are generally smaller than females (Lima et al. 2005; Ven√¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010).
","
Phyllomedusa bicolor is endemic to the Amazon Basin of Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Columbia, the Guianan Region of Venezuela and the Guianas, extreme eastern Panama, and the Cerrado of Maranh√£o, Brazil (Duellman et al. 2016; Ven√¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010). Such regions range from 0 - 900 m in elevation, encompassing freshwater wetlands and forests that can receive annual precipitation of 1900 to 2300 mm and warm to hot temperatures. Dry seasons can last from June to October while wet seasons from November to May (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004; Lima et al. 2005; IUCN 2010).
","
This species is nocturnal and arboreal (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004). 

The frogs can jump, but have been described by Caramaschi and Cruz (2002) to walk slowly on foliage to search for resting places or food, with their bright colors hidden during movement, and aposematically displayed at rest. 

Males call from high trees (ranging from 1 - 8 m) and vocalize around 19:00 hours, exhibiting fighting behavior over females (Ven√¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio 2010). Phyllomedusa bicolor displays breeding site fidelity, as well as low dispersal and movement patterns (Mota et al. 2020). 

Phyllomedusa bicolor possesses three dermal glands: mucous, lipid, and serous glands.  The mucous and lipid glands of P. bicolor produce cutaneous secretions for skin homeostasis. Serous glands, meanwhile, produce granules, which start small and fuse into larger granules, meant to store and eventually discharge venom; serous glands are the only integumental glands that contain the peptide I-13, which indicates the presence of biologically active and mature peptides (Barberio et al. 1987; Lacombe et al. 2000). Lacombe et al. (2000) and Ven√¢ncio and Melo-Sampaio (2010) both hypothesize that the biologically active peptides produced on the skin of P. bicolor, in addition to a large body size, aid in defense against predators.

Phyllomedusa bicolor follow Haddad and Prado‚Äôs reproductive Mode 24 (2005), where eggs hatch as exotrophic tadpoles that fall into still freshwater. A jelly-like mass of eggs with a mean of 859.5 eggs per clutch, is laid by females in leaf nests hanging over water. These nests are created by males roughly folding/joining 2 or 3 leaves and range from 1.4 - 2.8 m above the water (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004; Lima et al. 2005; Mota et al. 2020). Phyllomedusa bicolor has the largest clutch size of the Amazonian arboreal anuran nesters. As anuran eggs are a high-protein energy source,  P. bicolor clutches have predators of staphylinid beetles, phorid flies, and mammals; due to the large size of the eggs, P. bicolor  egg predation by mammals is unique when compared to P. tarsius and P. tomopterna (Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski 2004). 
","
Phyllomedusa bicolor has exotrophic larvae that inhabit non-flowing systems of water. As suspension-raspers, they partially feed through rasping submerged surfaces or filtering suspended particles from water columns (McDiarmid and Altig 1999). 

Described at Stage 36 by Pinto et al. (2013), but with information on Stages 24 - 40 available in the text, the total length of the larvae is between 41.32 - 46.17 mm, with the body roughly 40% of that length and the tail roughly 60%. From a lateral view, the body is triangular, and from a dorsal view, the body is elongated. The snout is truncated both laterally and dorsally. The nostrils are small and ovoid, positioned anterolaterally near the snout, with an internarial distance ~30% greater than eye diameter. The larvae have large eyes (a diameter of 2.28 - 2.46 mm), which are laterally positioned and directed. The interorbital distance is ~70% greater than eye diameter. The oral disc, with a width ranging from 4.00 - 4.50 mm, is anteriorly directed and ventrally emarginated. The marginal papillae is uniseriate and elongate, leaving a wide gap on the anterior labium, which is roughly two-thirds of the first anterior labial tooth row. Smaller, submarginal papillae are laterally present on the posterior and anterior labium. The labial tooth row formula is 2(2)/3(1). Anterior rows 1 and 2 are of similar length, while the second posterior row is shorter than the first posterior row, but double the length of the third posterior row. The second anterior row has a wide gap, while first posterior row has a small gap. Additionally, on the first posterior row, there are around 45 labial teeth per millimeter. The upper and lower jaw sheaths are wide with small, triangular-shaped, fine serrations. However, the upper jaw sheath is M-shaped, while lower is V-shaped. On the lower jaw sheath, there are around 27 serrations per millimeter (Pinto et al. 2013).

A posteriorly directed, singular spiracle is nearly ventral and has an absent inner wall. The spiracular opening is large, not visible dorsally, and located below the middle of the body. Attached to the right side of the ventral fin is the larvae‚Äôs short vent tube. The ventral fin itself is slightly arched, coming from the body terminus and consistent in height for two-thirds of its anterior, until it gradually tapers to the tip. The dorsal fin originates from the tail-body junction, featuring a unique cord (thickening on the edge of the fin) that is present throughout all stages. The upper fin is generally shallow, but is at its highest point toward the posterior, and extends nearly to the end of the tail. The caudal musculature is broader than the dorsal fin and gradually tapers to a pointed tip. Maximum tail height ranges from 8.00 - 9.44 mm, which is roughly double the maximum height of the tail musculature (Pinto et al. 2013).

In life, the tadpoles have orange dorsums and anterior parts of their body, in addition to a silver belly. The tail musculature and the dorsal fin‚Äôs unique cord is a paler orange, and the fins are a translucent orange. Their irises are also silver. In preservation, the light yellow body has a brownish gray dorsum, gray lateral side, and gray belly. The tail musculature and the dorsal fin‚Äôs unique cord is pale brown, while the casual musculature‚Äôs dorsal surface is brown. Their fins are translucent as well. Through the skin, intestines cannot be observed (Pinto et al. 2013).

From Stages 24 to 40, the larvae undergo changes in labial tooth row formula, vent tube distinction, and skin texture. The labial tooth row formula at Stage 24 is 1(1)/2(1) and 2(2)/3(1) or 2(2)/3(1-2) at Stages 26, 27, 29, and 34. After Stage 24, two anterior tooth rows and three posterior tooth rows stabilize, with posterior gaps only varying at advanced developmental stages. From early developmental stages (Stages 24 - 25), the vent tube is indistinct and the larvae are more slender, less pigmented, and lighter in tail musculature. From Stages 36, 37, 38, and 40, the lateral surfaces develop a grainy texture from the postorbital region to body terminus, with such a texture scarce ventrally (Pinto et al. 2013).

Phyllomedusa bicolor larvae, when compared to other Phyllomedusa larvae, similarly feature triangular bodies with anteroventral mouths and small nostrils near their snout. The larvae also have heavy caudal musculature, ventral fins deeper than the shallow dorsal fin, and a sinistral, nearly ventral spiracle. But, the tadpoles of P. bicolor are distinguishable from all closely related species, except P. vaillanti through their dorsal fin‚Äôs unique cord, which is visible at all stages. Phyllomedusa bicolor larvae can also be distinguished from P. bahiana larvae by their smaller size, papillae disposition, and coloration in life (where P. bahiana has marginal and sub-marginal papillae regularly and laterally positioned in double rows, and dorsolaterally on portions of the oral disc, a pale beige body and tail musculature, and very dark brown punctuations, giving a dark appearance, on the dorsal and lateral surfaces). A smaller size and coloration distinguish P. bicolor from Phyllomedusa boliviana, P. tomopterna, P. trinitatis, and P. tetraploidea (where, in life, P. boliviana has gold and black pigments with a transparent dorsum, a transparent belly, and gold lateral surfaces, P. tomopterna has a transparent whitish olive body, silver/yellow/yellowish tan abdomen, whitish/transparent tail with a diffuse orange patch in the middle of the lower fin, P. trinitatis has a distinct cluster of black spots on the ventral fin, which expand to form a black bar across the tail, and P. tetraploidea (unclear if in life) has a rectangular dark spot between its eyes). Phyllomedusa bicolor is differentiated from P. camba by their smaller size, depth of fins, labial tooth row formula, and coloration in life (where P. camba has ventral and dorsal fins of similar depth, a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3, dorsally black bodies that become dark bluish gray ventrally). Furthermore, P. bicolor is differentiated from P. vaillanti by their smaller size, labial tooth row formula, size of labial tooth row, and coloration in life (where P. vaillanti has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3 or 2(2)/3(1) with posterior 2 slightly greater than posterior 3, a black spot between the eyes, a gray-greenish body and tail and whitish belly in eastern Brazilian Amazon, and a dull green dorsum, pale green musculature, and white belly in Peru) (Pinto et al. 2013). Larger size, vent tube size and position, and coloration in life separates P. bicolor from P. atelopoides (where P. atelopoides has a longer vent tube that is sinistral to the ventral fin, a black brownish body, silvery blue belly, and pale lime green snout). Phyllomedusa bicolor larvae have a larger size, distribution of submarginal papillae, and coloration when compared to P. iheringi (where P. iheringi does not have submarginal papillae, but does feature four dark spots and a trapezoidal blotch on its head). The size of their labial tooth row distinguishes P. bicolor from P. burmeisteri and P. distincta (where in both species the second posterior tooth row is more than double the length of third posterior). Labial tooth row formula and distribution of marginal papillae separates P. bicolor from P. hypochondrialis (where P. hypochondrialis, in Venezuela, has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3 and a gap in the marginal papillae of its posterior labium). In addition, P. bicolor is separated from P. palliata by their labial tooth row formula and coloration in life (where P. palliata has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3 and bluish gray body and tail with a iridescent bluish green sheen on its belly). Only coloration in life distinguishes P. bicolor from P. tarsius (where P. tarsius  has a transparent olive/whitish body and a silver/pale metallic green belly). Lastly, P. bicolor is differentiated from P. venusta by the size of papillae gap (where P. venusta has a gap between papillae that is roughly one-third of the first anterior row) (Pinto et al. 2013).

Regarding development, Neckel-Oliveira and Wachlevski (2004) observed that embryonic development was quick, lasting 10.9 - 12.1 days, before the larvae hatch with external gills, falling into the water below, and developing into aquatic tadpoles. 

The development of the mucous, serous, and lipid glands were also observed by Lacombe et al. (2000) on the P. bicolor tadpole skin. The three glands appear as small granular structures in pigmented layers that are distinct on the dorsal skin. The structures, particularly the serous glands, develop into larger acini later. The lipid glands develop later during ontogenesis (Lacombe et al. 2000).
","
Phyllomedusa bicolor is threatened by logging and wood harvesting, but conservation sites have been established in the species‚Äô distribution (IUCN 2010).
","
The secretions of P. bicolor are commonly referred to as Sapo or Kamb√¥ and utilized in hunting rituals by indigenous people from the Southwestern Amazon basin, in particular Brazilians and the Matses Indians of Peru, (Erspamer et al. 1993; Aquila et al. 2017; Vega et al. 2020; Majiƒá et al. 2021). The secretion is meant as a remedy to panema (bad luck in hunting) by improving luck and strength, in addition to simply being used for salutogenic or detoxification purposes (Aquila et al. 2017; Majiƒá et al. 2021). To collect such secretions, P. bicolor is usually caught and kept for three days; its back and limbs are gently and periodically scraped with a stick, which is placed in a leaf bag over a fire, then used again to keep scrapping. After three days, the frog is respectfully released and the stick is covered in a yellow substance, which is mixed with saliva to be used and applied to intentionally burned wounds (Erspamer et al. 1993; Aquila et al. 2017). Kamb√¥ has gained popularity in alternative therapy clinics by Western users (Mota et al. 2020; Majiƒá et al. 2021). Phyllomedusa bicolor‚Äôs secretion itself contains up to 16 bioactive peptides which can function as opioids, vasoactive molecules, antimicrobials, antiprotozoals, or Œº-opioid receptors with analgesic properties (Aquila et al. 2017; Vega et al. 2020; Majiƒá et al. 2021). These biopeptides potentially affect the cardiovascular system of users, causing intense cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms (ranging from vomiting, hot flashes, diarrhea, racing heart, nausea, sweating, etc.) and mild psychoactive effects, as provided by anecdotal observations (notably a feeling that the spirit of the frog is with them) (Erspamer et al. 1993; Majiƒá et al. 2021). Hypotheses suggest that ceruletide and sauvagine may cause central effects, while ceruletide, phyllokinin, phyllomedusin, sauvagine and opioid peptides cause peripheral effects (Majiƒá et al. 2021). Majiƒá et al. (2021) believe that more research is indeed to investigate the effects of the secretion and determine any possible health concerns.
","
Two studies, one utilizing four mitochondrial genes and five nuclear genes (Faivovich et al. 2005) and another utilizing four mitochondrial genes and three nuclear genes (Wiens et al. 2006) determined that the Phyllomedusa genus is monophyletic. This was later supported by Duellman et al. (2016) through analysis of two mitochondrial genes and ten addition nuclear loci. Faivovich et al. (2005), further found that P. bicolor and P. vallanti are sister taxa, which is supported by the fact that both feature osteoderms (dermal ossifications) that protrude beyond the skin (Ruibal and Shoemaker 1984; Faivovich et al. 2010). However, as Faivovich et al. (2005), Wiens et al. (2006), and Duellman et al. (2016) were more broad scale analyses, it is unclear which species is unequivocally the most closely related to P. bicolor.  

Mota et al. (2020), on the other hand, used nucleotide sequences for the genes 16S, Cytb, and RAG-1 to determine that P. bicolor likely has two cryptically divergent lineages corresponding to a geographic division in the eastern and western regions of Amazonia, in addition to the Amazon‚Äôs well-defined climate gradient. The eastern Amazonia likely is compromised of populations in the Guiana Shield and the Brazilian Shield.

The name of the genus Phyllomedusa is derived from the Greek, ‚Äúphyllo‚Äù, which means ‚Äúleaf/foliage,‚Äù and ‚Äúmedousa,‚Äù which means ‚Äúqueen/protector.‚Äù Therefore, Phyllomedusa means ‚Äúqueen/protector of the foliage‚Äù and alludes to the green color and large size of members of the genus (Caramaschi and Cruz 2002). 

Boddaert (1772) originally named Phyllomedusa bicolor as Rana bicolor until Wagler (1830) proposed the species be placed in Phyllomedusa (Caramaschi and Cruz 2002).

In analysis of the ultrastructure sperm of P. bicolor, as compared to P. hypochondrialis and P. tarsius, P. bicolor was determined to have similar structures to P. tarsius. Relative to P. hypochondrialis, both species had a large spermatozoon with a reduced nuclear space, an abruptly ending anterior region in the nucleus, and a larger axial fibre; the subacrosomal cones, which fill the space between the acrosome vesicle and nucleus, are also transversely less electron-dense and more granular (Costa et al. 2005).

The snout-vent length for Phyllomedusa sauvagii ranges from 69.0 - 89.2 mm for males and between 83.4 - 96.6 mm for females. The head of the frog is longer than it is wide, and shaped like a trapezoid from both the dorsal and lateral view. This makes a broad, angular head that is not as wide as the body. The snout itself is truncated (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). The teeth on the maxilla and premaxilla both have circular tips. Phyllomedusa sauvagii possesses vertically elliptical pupils in relatively protruding eyes (Kok and Kalamandeen 2008). This anuran has well-developed, protruding parotoid glands (De La Riva 1999). A singular, subgular, and non-distinct vocal sac, as well as vocal slits are present (Duellman 2010; Kok and Kalamandeen 2008). The tympanum is visible on the sides of the head (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). The skin of P. sauvagii exhibits distinct wrinkles (De La Riva 1999). Phyllomedusa sauvagii has long, thin limbs, reduced terminal discs in the phalanges, lacks toe webbing, and has opposable thumbs used to grip trees (Wells 2007; Sheil and Alamillo 2005). 

Larvae measure around 6.7 mm at stage 24. At this stage gills are still present, but have an opercular fold covering the base.  Gill ciliation is also still present. The tail is relatively long, measuring around 0.7 mm, with high fins and narrows to a thin flagellum. The defining features of the mouth are the presence of two marginal papillae and serrated jaw sheaths in the oral disc. Keratodonts and amedical spiracle aren‚Äôt seen in the larvae until stage 25 of development (Salica et al. 2011).

The skull of Phyllomedusa sauvagii resembles that of P. vaillantii and P. venusta, with less resemblance seen in P. atelopoides (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). Unlike the P. tarsius  group, P. sauvagii does not have black reticulations in the iris (De La Riva 1999). The truncated snout is distinct from that of other related species, such as P. vaillanti, which have round snouts (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016). The body of P. sauvagii is larger, more robust and round than P. boliviana and P. burmeisteri, which are especially slender and angular (Rodrigues et al. 2007). 

 In life, the body of P. sauvagii ranges from light-brownish to bright green with a very distinctive opaque overlayer from their natural waxy coating (De La Riva 1999). In preservative, its skin turns to a deep purple (Kok and Kalamandeen 2008). Most frogs have distinctive white ventral stripes, varying in continuity, distinctiveness and placement. Most frogs also have a variable white striped marking along the bottom mandible that extends down the length of the body. In addition, some individuals may have orange and black coloration on the bottom sides of their limbs that vary in continuity and placement. Their eyes are a pale gray color (De La Riva 1999).

 Sexual dimorphism is present in P. sauvagii. The snouts of females are rounder than males (Rodrigues et al. 2007). Females are larger than males and the mass of the gonads make up a higher percentage of the female‚Äôs body mass (Rodrigues et al. 2007). In addition, the maxillae are bent in the females and straighter in males (Ruiz-Monachesi et al. 2016).

","
Phyllomedusa sauvagii can be found in South American rainforests and humid montane forests, specifically in the Chacoan region of eastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, Mato Grosso do Sul of central Brazil, and Northern Argentina (Duellman 2010; Aquino et al. 2004). The species can be found up to 1500 meters above sea level (Aquino et al. 2004).
","
Phyllomedusa sauvagii is an arboreal breeder that, during mating season, lives near temporary lagoons and flooded fields and has adapted to living in areas with dry seasons (Aquino et al. 2004, Rodrigues et al. 2007). During the dry period, individuals can be found ‚Äúin small forest fragments near to ponds‚Äù (Rodrigues et al. 2007). 

In accordance with its nocturnal lifestyle, the frog calls at night, usually around two hours after sunset (Rodrigues et al. 2007). During the rainy seasons, the male P. sauvagii will call nearly every night. This occurs when heavy rainfall over several days fills nearby ponds (Schaulk et al. 2016). In addition, Halloy and Espinoza (2000) found that all P. sauvagii males will fight over some calling sites, but did not determine if it is specifically for oviposition sites or calling sites (Wells 2007). Corresponding with calling, reproduction occurs in the rainy season, from October to May (Rodrigues et al. 2007). Phylomedusa sauvagii has characteristics of both an explosive breeder and a prolonged breeder in that there is a concentration of males calling after rain, but the reproductive period lasts longer than 6 months (Rodrigues et al. 2007). After vocalizing on shrubs during heavy rainy days (and up to 2 days after), a mating pair will go to a pond or a flooded field and into the vegetation (Wells 2007, Rodrigues et al. 2007). The males do not seem to actively search for females, and the females do not exhibit polyandry (Rodrigues et al. 2007). 

Like many of the Phyllomedusa genus,  P. sauvagii  lays terrestrial clutches in nests made out of leaves (Wells 2007). In axillary amplexus, the parents use their body weight and movement of their legs to fold up one to three leaves of the Asteraceae family, into which they deposit their clutches. The pair places their nest above water (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Garcia et al. 2013). Amongst the eggs, there are gelatinous eggless capsules, which, along with the folded leaf nests, decrease chances of desiccation (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Wells 2007). Additionally, because of the non-aquatic egg phase, females choose microhabitats specifically to reduce desiccation (Garcia et al. 2013). 

Eggs are relatively large (2.54 mm is the average) and highly yokey, with a range of 201 to 829 eggs per clutch (Rodrigues et al. 2007; Salica et al. 2011). Phyllomedusa sauvagii has indirect development and ontogeny. Complete embryonic development lasts around seven days (Salica et al. 2011). Larvae feed on the yolk in the egg until they hatch (Rodrigues et al. 2007). Once they hatch, tadpoles fall from their leaf nests down into the water (Garcia et al. 2013). Gill regression begins once the tadpoles enter the water, occasionally fully regressing within two hours (Salica et al. 2011). 

Since  P. sauvagii  lives in a habitat that has a limited and unpredictable amount of water, the adults exhibit uricotelism. Additionally, P. sauvagii larvae exhibit ureotelism, despite the fact that they are aquatic. This means that they secrete urea, and only start excreting uric acid during metamorphosis (Hellman et al. 2009).

In females, there is a positive correlation between snout-vent length and ovary mass, as well as body and ovary mass. However, the number of mature eggs has no correlation with either body mass or snout-vent length. Females also have no correlation between snout-vent length and reproductive energy. However, there is a  negative correlation between reproductive output and body mass.  In males, there are no major correlations between snout-vent length and reproductive energy, and no correlation between body mass and reproductive energy (Rodrigues et al. 2007).

Generally, arboreal frogs have lower evaporative water loss than non-arboreal frogs. We see even lower evaporative water loss in Phyllomedusa (Shoemaker et al. 1975; Faivovich et al. 2010). Phyllomedusa sauvagii achieves these low rates through waxy skin secretions that are produced by skin lipid glands and spread over the body through movement of the hind limbs and rear in a motion referred to as ‚Äúwiping behavior‚Äù of which there are four variations (Blaylock et al. 1976; Gomez et al. 2006). The waxy secretion is a mix of wax esters and triglycerides, with free fatty acids and hydrocarbons that block water evaporation up to 38 to 39 degrees Celsius (McClanahan et al. 1978; Hillman et al. 2009). This waxy secretion, along with the excretion of uric acid (up 80% of the nitrogen waste), and diurnal torpor, allows for impermeabilization of the skin (Castanho et al. 2001). Due to its waterproof skin, the frog can bask in the sunlight and raise its body temperature from 35 to 40 degrees Celsius. When dehydrated, P. sauvagii will increase their body temperature, supposedly for water conservation. To prevent overheating, they use a mucous gland discharge. Phyllomedusa in general can use their serous skin glands to modulate secretions, similar to sweating in other animals (Hillman et al. 2009).

 When not sitting on small branches with its legs tucked in, P. sauvagii moves by walking instead of hopping (Wells 2007; Soliz and Ponssa 2016). Due to this walking gait and its opposable digits, the frog has a lemuroid manner of climbing (Duellman 2010). The genus Phyllomedusa is adapted to an arboreal lifestyle, specifically in the forelimb. The forelimb has an ‚Äúelongation and increase in size of the muscles, the presence of strong and long tendons, ‚Ä¶ and the presence of elongated and naked bony areas‚Äù (Manzano et al. 2008). Muscles have accessory branches, and there is a greater abduction of the fifth digit, which all allow for a better grip. Interestingly, P. sauvagii can utilize a precision grip on narrow branches and in its wiping behavior; precision grip is only seen elsewhere in higher primates (Manzano et al. 2008).

The small, narrow leaves of Asteraceae can expose the eggs, so when egg predation is evident, it seems that the eggs are wrapped in more leaves. Adult anurans also see predation from birds and crocodiles (Rodrigues et al. 2007).

While the diet of P. sauvagii remains unclear, assumptions can be made based on closely related species. Most anurans eat terrestrial invertebrates. The frog‚Äôs sister taxon, the P. burmeisteri group, regularly eats arthropods (de Paula Lima et al. 2010). Pyllomedusa sauvagii practices dermatophagy, which means that they ingest stratum corneum after molting. This provides a supplementary source of vitamin D and proteins (Castanho et al. 2001). During rain, P. sauvagii drinks rain drops that drip from the leaves of its habitat by lifting its snout in the air to pump water down its throat, allowing the frog to obtain water without leaving its primary habitat (Wells 2007; Hillman et al. 2009).




","

","
This species currently has a stable population trend and has an IUCN Red Listing status of ""Least Concern"". However, P. sauvagii is threatened by the international pet trade, habitat destruction, pollution, and fires (Aquino et al. 2004). In the C√≥rdoba, Argentina part of the Chacoan forest, forest degradation from logging and overgrazing has simplified diversity and structure. This changes the frog‚Äôs ability to find proper vegetation for reproduction (Garcia et al. 2013). 

Larval development is also affected by arboreal habitat partially converted for agriculture or lost completely (Rodrigues et al. 2007). In addition, the rate of gametogenesis in the frog has been observed to decline in times of high heat and drought (Wells 2007). 

While there are no specific conservation efforts for P. sauvagii, the frog occurs in several protected areas (Aquino et al. 2004). Within the Chacoan forest specifically, there are many protected areas, including the Bolivian Chaco, with indigenous people co-managing a large area of land (Arambiza and Painter 2006).

","
These frogs are part of the international pet trade but are not protected under the CITES Treaty Act. Of the 33,000 amphibians recorded in the Hong Kong pet trade between 1 December 2005 and 30 November 2006, five were found to be  P. sauvagii (Rowley et al. 2007). 

In addition to the pet trade, P. sauvagii skin toxins are being researched for their antimicrobial properties. Important compounds include Phylloseptin-1, which is potent in eliminating Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (Zhang et al. 2010), Phylloseptins-S, which is an anti-parasitic against the promastigote of Leishmania infantum, Leishmania braziliensis, and Leishmania major (although toxic to mammalian cells)(Raja et al. 2013), and Sauvagine, which is used in the pharmacy industry for its linked similarity to urotensin I and as aid in diuresis, cardiovascular system, and endocrine system functions (Mantecucchi and Henschen 1980).

Through the sequencing of 12 nuclear and mitochondrial genes, plus three intervening tRNA sequences, P. sauvagii is found to belong to the family Hylidae, the subfamily Phyllomedusinae, and the genus Phyllomedusa. Thirty species belong to this genus, which contains two main clades and four main groups. However, the four groups do not encompass all species within the genus (Salica et al. 2011). Phyllomedusa sauvagii does not belong to any of the four groups. The clade that P. sauvagii belongs to includes P. boliviana, P. camba, P. bicolor, P. vailantii, and the P. burmeisteri and P. tarsius groups. Phyllomedusa sauvagii is the sister taxon to the P. burmeisteri group, and P. boliviana is the sister taxon to P. sauvagii and the P. burmeisteri group. Phyllomedusa sauvagii is ‚Äúone of the most highly specialized members of the evolutionary line,‚Äù due to its ‚Äúreduced discs on the digits and the prominent parotoid glands‚Äù (Faivovich et al. 2010).

The genera name means leaf guardian where ‚Äúphyllo‚Äù is Greek for leaf and ‚Äúmedousa‚Äù is Greek for guardian. The species epithet, ""sauvagii"", was named after Dr. Henri-Emile Sauvage, a French paleontologist, herpetologist, and ichthyologist who lived from 1844 to 1917 (Boelens et al. 2013).

Pseudacris crucifer is a small species of frog, ranging from .75 of an inch to 1.25 inches in total length. A characteristic 'X' mark can usually be seen on the back of the frog. While P. crucifer displays no distinct color patterns on its surface, its observed color may be yellow, brown, gray or olive. This species may be distinguished from other members of the genus by its lack in distinct stripes, mottling, spotting, and the characteristic 'X' mark.

","
Geographically, this species may be found from the Canadian Maritime Provinces to northern Florida, and from southeast Manitoba all the way to eastern Texas. One isolated (but natural) population exists in Kansas and an introduced population exists into Cuba. P. crucifer tends to be found in large numbers near ponds or swamps in brushy growth or cutover woodlands. Small, temporary or semipermanent lentic environments are ideal water sources for P. crucifer. Standing trees or shrubs provide a popular habitat for the choral groups to form.

Pseudacris nigrita is a small frog with a snout-vent length ranging from 19 - 32 mm. The head and body are narrow, and the snout is pointed. There‚Äôs basal webbing between the second, third, and fourth toes. The tips of the digits are moderately expanded (Gates 1988).

At the time of hatching, larvae are approximately 4.5 mm long. The maximum length of larvae can be up to 35.0 mm long. Newly-transformed froglets are between 8.5 and 15.0 mm long (Gates 1988).

Pseudacris nigrita resembles cricket frogs of the genus Acris. However, cricket frogs have prominent stripes near their rear thigh, and these are absent in P. nigrita. Additionally, P. nigrita has a snout that is notably more pointed than other species of chorus frogs (Conant and Collins 1998).

In life, Pseudacris nigrita‚Äôs dorsal surface can be between tan and black in color, often with three dark, horizontal stripes or rows of dots. The middle stripe extends up to the snout, but not all individuals have it. The upper lip may have small spots, wavy streaks, or a distinct stripe of white. Pseudacris nigrita has a dark band extending from the snout to the groin, trailing along the side of the body. The limbs appear either striped or spotted, with darker bars along the tibia. The ventral surface is typically a pale yellow and may be speckled with dark spots. Males have smooth, green-ish yellow to orange throats (Gates 1988).

In life, at hatching, P. nigrita larvae have a light lateral stripe that extends from the eye to the tail. Dark melanophore spots can be seen in the dorsal tail fin, and the tail musculature is tan above and a dull yellow below. The chest and abdomen are dull yellow as well. Pseudacris nigrita at Gosner stage 37, have a dark brown dorsal surface with golden specks and black spots. The tail fins are covered with melanophores. The ventral surface is dark, except for the center of the abdomen, which is golden in color. This gold area often forms a triangle pointing anteriorly (Gates 1988).

Pseudacris nigrita is commonly split into two subspecies: Pseudacris nigrita nigrita and Pseudacris nigrita verrucosa. Like most chorus frogs, P. nigrita nigrita has a white upper lip. P. nigrita verrucosa, however, has a black upper lip (Conant and Collins 1998).

","
Pseudacris nigrita can be found in most regions of the southeastern United States, including in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. They largely inhibit inner wetlands and forest habitats (IUCN 2014).

","
Pseudacris nigrita breeds in a variety of small, shallow waters, including small ponds, puddles, and roadside ditches. Some specimens have also been collected from meadows and woods (Martof and Thompson 1958). 

Ideal breeding locations have shallow water and many kinds of grass and vegetation. Their breeding season is long, beginning in November and ending in April. The most active breeding occurs during rainy weather (Martof and Thompson 1958).

The P. nigrita call is described as a musical trill (Conant and Collins 1998). Frog calls can be heard at the beginning of the breeding season, in November, but large ‚Äúchoruses‚Äù -- used to describe large groups of calling frogs -- are not heard until December and January when it rains. Choruses and breeding behavior may be interrupted by cold weather, but the choruses continue largely-uninterrupted through March. By April, there are notably fewer choruses, but scattered calls can be heard through May (Martof and Thompson 1958).


","

","
Pseudacris nigrita has an IUCN status of ""Least Concern"" because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and apparent tolerance to habitat modification. Local subpopulations are threatened by clear-cutting and urbanization, but overall, the species does not have any major threats. 
","

","
Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian methods were used to analyze 12S, tRNAval, and 16S rRNA mtDNA genes of the Pseudacris genus, with consistent results. Four distinct clades were identified: West Coast, Fat Frogs, Crucifer, and Trilling Frogs. Pseudacris nigrita is a member of the ‚Äútrilling frog clade,‚Äù which includes the nigrita clade and a sister group of P. brimleyi and P. brachyphona (Moriarty and Cannatella  2004). The nigrita clade includes P. clarkii,  P. feriarum, P. fouquettei P. kalmi, P. maculata, P. nigrita, and P. triseriata . The nigrita clade was further split into three clades based on geographic divisions: those west of the Mississippi River, including P. maculata and triseriata, those in the southeastern United States, P. fouquettei and P. nigrita, and northeastern US species including P. feriarum, P. kalmi, and P. triseriata. The sister species of P. nigrita is P. fouquettei, which was described in 2008 (Moriarty and Cannatella  2004, Moriarty Lemmon et al. 2008).

Pseudacris nigrita is split into two subspecies: P. nigrita nigrita and P. nigrita verrucosa. However, Moriarty and Cannatella (2004) discourage the recognition and usage of these subspecies, claiming that they are uninformative.

The species epithet, ‚Äúnigrita‚Äù is a reference to the overall dark coloration of Pseudacris nigrita (Gates 1988).

The Pacific Chorus frog is a small frog, about 3/4 to 2 inches, that has expanded toe disks and a black eye-stripe (Stebbins 1985). The stripe runs from the tip of the snout posteriorly through the eye to the forelimb insertion (Grismer 2002).   
The stripe may be hard to see in dark frogs, but it is always present. The dorsal coloration is highly variable, and can be gray, tan, green, brown, or black, and it may change color from dark to light within a few minutes. It often has a triangular dark spot on the head and dark spots on the back and legs, and the clarity of these spots changes as the frog changes its color phase. Its limbs are crossbanded or blotched with dark color, and the posterior has a yellow or orange color, especially on the under surfaces of the limbs, the rear of the femur, and in the groin. Males have a wrinkled and dusky throat. When the male‚Äôs vocal sac is deflated, often 8 to 12 longitudinal folds are present (Stebbins 1985).   
It has webbed hind toes with a margin of the web between successive toes. Skin is usually smooth with a few tubercles but occasionally quite rough. It has a round tympanum, that is anywhere from 1/4 to slightly over 1/2 the size of the eye opening, located in the eye stripe. The thenar tubercle is elongated and ovoid, while the palmar tubercle is made of 3 small, closely associated tubercles totaling the size of the thenar tubercle (Stebbins 1951).

Distributed from mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island through Washington, Oregon, California, and the tip of Baja California. P. regilla can be found on Catalina, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz, islands off the coast of southern California, and on Isla Cedros, an island off the west coast of central Baja California. Distribution also extends east to eastern Nevada and western Montana. It lives in habitats from sea level to 11,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada (Grismer 2002).   
This species seeks cover in many places, including rock fissures, under bark, in vegetation along streams, in rodent and other burrows, in nooks and crannies in buildings, and in culverts. It can be found in springs, ponds, irrigation canals, streams, and other bodies of water, but it has also been found as far as ¬Ω mile from water (Stebbins 1951).  
Out of the water, it frequents habitats like grassland, chaparral, woodland, desert oases, forest, and farmland (Stebbins 1985).  
 
 
 
 
 

","
Breeding: P. regilla breeds over a long period of time, from January to the middle of May, in marshes, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, roadside ditches, and slow streams (Stebbins 1985).   
In interior British Colombia, it may breed in June and July also. Later breeding occurs in higher altitudes. Around January, at the beginning of the breeding season, large numbers of vociferous males congregate at transient rain pools and more permanent bodies of water. The females do not enter the water until later, when they are ready to lay. Usually, females enter in the late afternoon or early evening, and mating and egg laying usually occurs by the following morning. Females enter either by themselves or in small groups, so there are many more males than females, making immediate mating probable. Usually, there is a preliminary period of clasping that lasts anywhere from 4 to 24 hours in a laboratory, and probably about 4 to 10 hours in nature. The male tightly grips the female with is forelimbs, but does not contact her with his body behind his pectoral region except when inseminating eggs. The male‚Äôs legs are flexed in a sitting pose, and insemination occurs at the moment of the extrusion of the eggs. The male discharges a quantity of transparent semen by bringing his cloacal aperture close to that of the female. With a quick, firm extension, the male slides his feet posteriorly over the sides and hips of the female, then retracts to his previous position. Simultaneously, the female extrudes a clutch of eggs into the cloud of sperm. The female sometimes scratches the substratum on which the eggs are going to be deposited before releasing the eggs. As the female extrudes the eggs, her cloaca is brought close to this surface and their attachment is effected. The eggs may be removed from her cloaca by her tarsi through flexor-extensor reflexes. The interval between layings is usually 2 to 10 minutes, but could be longer. After oviposition, the frogs separate. Amplexus is pectoral, and may last from 8 to 40 hours or longer (Smith 1940).  
 
Eggs: Clusters of eggs are deposited in a pond‚Äôs shallow water, usually at depths above 4 inches. The clusters can be attached to sticks, leaves, vegetation, or other objects, and they can also be found floating on the surface, usually attached to objects. Eggs are usually laid in loose clusters of irregular shape, and the cluster has 2 gelatinous envelopes. The outer envelope is 4.78 to 6.7 mm and is sticky, and the inner envelope is 1.88 to 2.70 mm. Each packet usually has 22 to 25 eggs, but could have anywhere from 5 to 60 eggs.  As the layings near an end, the number of eggs per clutch can decrease to 3 or 4, or even single eggs (Livezey and Wright 1947).  

Larva: The tadpole is about 45 mm long, full and deep-bodied, and has a fairly long tail, about 2 times the head and body length. The labial tooth row formula is 2/3, and the spiracle is sinistral, directed posteriorly (Grismer 2002).   
The general color is blackish and yellowish brown to dark brown with heavy black spots. Below, it is whitish with bronze or copper tinges. The tail is mottled with black, and the iris is golden, with a darker area anterior and posterior to the pupil (Stebbins 1951).  
 
Call: P. regilla is the most commonly heard frog species on the Pacific coast. The calls last for about 1 second and are often uttered in sequence. Each 1-second call consists of a loud, two-parted 'kreck-ek', with rising inflection in the last syllable. P. regilla has a round vocal sac (Stebbins 1985).  
While singing, a male may float with his limbs outstretched and his globular pouch extended to or beyond his chin (Stebbins 1951).

Food: P. regilla eats insects, including leaf-hoppers, spring-tails, flies, stoneflies, ants, wasps, beetles, and caterpillars, It also eats spiders, isopods, and snails (Stebbins 1972).  

Behavior: P. regilla is mainly nocturnal, but it is also active in the daytime. Sometimes, at low elevations, it is active throughout the year. It is a good climber, but usually stays near the ground. It has a great capacity for color change, and a change from an unspotted dark coloration through a medium light colored phase with spots to an unspotted light phase may take about 8 to 10 minutes (Stebbins 1951).

A similar species, Pseudacris cadaverina, the California Treefrog, usually does not have an eye-stripe, has larger toe pads, and more fully webbed hind toes. The California Treefrog also is rarely green. Another similar species, Hyla eximia, the Mountain Treefrog, the eye-stripe extends beyond the shoulder and webbing is reduced (Stebbins 1985).  

It is certain that there are isolated populations of P. regilla in many unexplored canyons of the Sierra la Giganta that harbor hidden permanent springs. In some water systems west of San Ignacio, there is evidence that P. regilla is being displaced by the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana (Grismer 2002).  

This species was featured in News of the Week 28 March 2022: 
The amphibian skin microbiome plays an important role in protecting its hosts against pathogens such as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), one of the causative agents of chytridiomycosis. Bd is comprised of multiple genetic lineages that may exhibit differences in their ability to cause disease. Basanta et al. (2021) investigated if differences in Bd genetic variation are linked to differences in the amphibian skin microbiome. They studied associations between Bd infection load, Bd genetic diversity, and skin bacterial communities in populations of Pseudacris regilla (=Hyliola regilla (hypochondriaca)) of Baja California, Mexico. They found that Bd isolates have genetic spatial structure, and the Bd genetic differences and infection load are correlated with the skin bacterial community composition of P. regilla. Their results indicate that skin-associated bacteria and Bd strains likely interact on the host skin, highlighting this key microbial interaction as an important factor in shaping amphibian-Bd disease dynamics.

Pseudacris streckeri can reach a maximum size of 48 mm.  It is the largest of the chorus frogs,  with a stout, toadlike body and forearms.  This frog has a dark stripe through its eyes from snout to shoulder, dark spots along the side of the body, dark blotches on the dorsum (back), a white belly, and yellow or orange-yellow pigmentation on the groin.  Coloration may be gray, brown, olive, or green in the subspecies P. streckeri streckeri, but the dorsum is never green in the subspecies P. streckeri illinoisensis. Most P. streckeri have a dark spot below the eye. P. streckeri can be distinguished from all other chorus frogs within its range by its lack of a continuous light line along the upper lip. During the breeding season, the vocal pouch of the male becomes dark. 
","
One subspecies, P. s. streckeri, occurs in south-central Kansas through Oklahoma and down into eastern Texas, as well as west-central Arkansas and western Louisiana. This subspecies can be found in a variety of habitats: shady woods, stream edges, cultivated fields, rocky ravines, sand prairies, or associated with lagoons or cypress swamps.   
 
The other subspecies, P. s. illinoisensis, is found in disjunct populations in west-central and southwest Illinois, southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. It prefers mainly sand prairies and cultivated fields.
","
This nocturnal frog is fossorial, burrowing in the soil in order to shield itself from predation and heat. While most burrowing frogs dig backward with their hind legs, P. streckeri is unusual in digging forward with its front legs and entering the hole headfirst. It is one of only a handful of burrowing frog species to do so. 
It emerges from the sand after early spring rains in order to breed. P. streckeri breeds in flooded fields, ditches, small ponds, and vernal pools.  The breeding call of Strecker's Chorus Frog is composed of a series of clear, high-pitched single-note whistles, resembling that of Pseudacris ornata, the Ornate Chorus Frog.  The sound of a large chorus of P. streckeri has been described as ""a rapidly turning pulley wheel badly in need of greasing."" Eggs are deposited in water attached to submerged vegetation, and hatch within a few days; the tadpoles transform in two months.  
 
P. streckeri primarily eats small insects.  

","

","
The subspecies P. s. illinoisensis has been reported to be threatened in Illinois by the  
 Illinois Natural History Survey.

Scinax boulengeri is moderately sized. Adult males range from 36 to 49 mm, while adult females range from 42 to 53 mm snout-vent length (Savage 2002). Scinax boulengeri has a pointed, acuminate snout, tuberculate dorsum, white vocal sac, long webless fingers with truncated discs, and thighs marked by a contrasting pattern of black and yellow or green vertical bars. A dark spot is commonly found on the groin (Duellman 2001). It has a distinctive shape due to a strongly flattened body and protruding nostrils (Guyer 2005).

Dorsally, the skin is tuberculate.  The ventral surfaces of the limbs have smooth skin, but the belly and the posteroventral surfaces of the thighs have granular skin.  Individuals from Costa Rica (the Golfo Dulce region) are more tuberculate than those from the Caribbean lowlands of Central America (Duellman 2001). The top of the head is slightly convex and the lips are flared. The long snout is acuminate in both lateral and dorsal profiles, with the tip extending beyond the lower jaw. The nostrils point dorsolaterally and are positioned just above the leading edge of the lower jaw. A thin dermal fold runs from the posterior edge of the eye, above the tympanum, to just above the insertion of the arm. This fold covers the upper edge of the tympanum.  The tongue is narrowly heart-shaped.  Vocal slits extend to the angle of the jaw. There is a single, median vocal sac which is moderately distendable (Duellman 2001).

The arm lacks an axillary membrane and is moderately long and slender. The ventrolateral edge of the forearm has no tubercles and the wrist has no transverse fold. The long and thin fingers are unwebbed and have large truncate discs, with the width of the third finger's disc about equal to the tympanum. Narrow dermal fringes are present on the edges of the digits. Each digit also has small, conical supernumerary tubercles on its proximal segment. Large, round subarticular tubercles are present.  There is a single flat, tripartite palmar tubercle, and an elongated, flat prepollical tubercle.  Duellman (2001) states that males do not possess nuptial excrescences on the prepollex, which is only slightly enlarged, but Savage (2002) directly contradicts this and says that adult males have whitish nuptial pads. Hindlimbs are also moderately long and slender. The tibiotarsal articulation extends to a point between the eye and the nostril. There is a weak tarsal fold, and a thin transverse dermal fold on the heel, as well as one or two tubercles. The inner metatarsal tubercle is low, flat, and rounded. The outer metatarsal tubercle is small and conical when present. Toes are long and slender, with truncate discs nearly as large as those on the fingers. The toes are about three-fourths webbed, with the webbing on the first and second toes present as a fringe on the medial side of the first toe and the lateral edge of the second toe. The subarticular tubercles are large and rounded. Small, rounded supernumerary tubercles are present in a single row on the proximal segment of each digit.


 Scinax boulengeri is grayish tan, brown, or dull green with darker brown markings, which usually consist of a dark triangular mark between the eyes and two or more dark blotches on the back.  Forearms, thighs, shanks, and feet have transverse bars. The iris is bronze. The throat is white, spotted with small gray flecks.  The venter is creamy white, while the groin is pale green with one to several black spots or mottling.  Flanks are pale yellowish green.  The anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs have long, vertical black bars, separated by pale green, yellowish green, or yellow-orange interspaces.  (Duellman 2001). 

 A typical tadpole in developmental stage 38 has a body length of 11.5 mm and total length of 33.5 mm. The larval body is slightly deeper than wide. The snout is rounded, with small, anterolateral nostrils.  The eyes are moderately large and directed laterally. The spiracle is sinistral, with the opening directed posteriorly. The vent (cloacal tube) is short and dextral. The caudal musculature is somewhat shallow and tapers gradually. The caudal fins are deep, with the dorsal fin extending onto the body nearly to the posterior edge of the eye.  The tail tip ends in a sharp point (Duellman 2001). The larval mouth is small and anteroventral, with massive, heavily serrated beaks. The lips have a single lateral row of blunt papillae and also have lateral folds with small conical papillae. There are two upper rows of denticles, which are of equal length and extend to the lip, and three shorter lower rows of teeth. The second upper row is narrowly interrupted medially (Duellman 2001). The lower lip has a catapult-like extension with long, pointed denticles (Savage 2002).

In the wild, the larval body is silvery yellow, the fins are transparent, and the caudal musculature is pale cream. The tail has large, closely spaced black spots on the middle two-thirds of its length. In preserved tadpoles, these spots are the only pigment visible (Duellman 2001).

","
Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama; Pacific slopes from Costa Rica to Ecuador. Scinax boulengeri lives in humid, lowland tropical forests with rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year (Duellman 2001).
","
Scinax boulengeri is nocturnal and arboreal.  It can be found near the forest floor perching on bushes, stumps, logs, and low trees, as well as in secondary growth and isolated trees and shrubs in pastures and open areas (Scott 1983).

This species is a prolonged breeder, with peaks occurring in May/June and again in August. In humid areas males call throughout the year but in drier areas calling occurs from May to November (Savage 2002). Bevier (1997) states that calling was not correlated to the amount of rainfall.  However, this statement differs from other accounts, some of which assert that calling males are more numerous on rainy nights (Guyer 2005). 

Scinax boulengeri males begin congregating at pond breeding sites soon after the first heavy rains of the season (Bevier 1997). The males generally begin their 3 to 4 hour calls at dusk in areas bordering bodies of water, rarely moving from their initial areas during the same night. Males call from secluded spots on stumps or logs while hidden under vegetation, as well as from dense bushes, depressions in logs, and stumps at pondside or in the water (Duellman 2001). Calling rates reduce greatly after the first hour, as do the physical aggressions from establishing territory. Calls consist of a single low and guttural note, emitted over intervals lasting between ten seconds to several minutes, usually with the head down and cocked away from the substrate (Savage 2002; Guyer 2005). Call notes have a fundamental frequency of around 71 cycles/second and two harmonics of 1600 and 2800 cycles/second, with a duration of 0.24 to 0.27 seconds and a pulse rate of 80-120 pulses/second (Duellman 2001).


 Amplexus occurs out of water, and the eggs are laid in shallow water (Savage 2002). The female lays 600-700 eggs in water, each ranging from 1.5 to 1.6 mm. in diameter (Jungfer 1987).  Eggs hatch in 1 to 1.5 days, while tadpoles take 40 to 88 days to reach metamorphosis (Jungfer 1987). 

Tadpoles feed on small crustaceans and other aquatic insect larvae, as well as developing conspecific and heterospecific tadpoles (Savage 2002). The catapult-like, toothed extension of the larval lower lip aids in flipping prey into the mouth (Savage 2002).  The heaviest predation on Scinax boulengeri tadpoles is by other tadpoles, most likely including cannibalistic predation by this species (Roberts 1994).
The adult diet consists of arthropods (Guyer 2005).

This is the largest tree frog native to the United States (Bartlett 1999). It is also the largest species in the genus (Duellman 1970). 
 
Males are about 76 mm and females reach a maximum of 90 mm. Chubby, stocky and short-legged (Savage 2002). 
 
Broad, flat head, indistinct from body. It is distinguished from other species by having a row of warts along the lower arm. Snout is rounded in dorsal view and bluntly truncate in lateral view. Large prominent eyes with horizontally ellipted pupils, and gold or silver irises. Distinct tympanum with a diameter about two-thirds of the eye. Dorsal skin is smooth and venter skin is granular (Lee 2000). 
  
Varies in color and pattern. The upper surface of S. baudinii can be a shade of green, tan or brown with a pattern of dark patches. Metachrosis is extreme and individuals can change colors depending on circumstances (although individuals tend to retain their dark blotches usually outlined by black) (Savage 2002). 
 The vocal sac of breeding males is grey (Leenders 2001). 
 Males have dark throats and females have light throats (Bartlett 1999). 
 
 The undersurfaces are white to creamy yellow, usually devoid of markings (Lee 2000). 
 A dark streak extends from the eye onto the shoulder region. There is also a vertical black bar that lies on the upper lip directly below the eye (Norman 1998). 
 
Similar to S. phaeota, the dorsal surface of the hind limbs have dark transverse bars (Leenders 2001). 
 Has contrasting yellow and black mottling on the back of the thighs and especially in groin region (Norman 1998). 
 Moderately large appendages. Toes are extensively webbed. Fingers are extensively webbed at bases (Savage 2002). 

","
Humid, subhumid and semiarid lowlands and marginally on premontane slopes from southern Sonora, Mexico, and extreme southeastern Texas to southeastern and southwestern Costa Rica (Savage 2002). 
Probably more common in urban backyards with pools than in the wild. Occurs in the vicinity of canals, resacas, ponds, pools and other water retaining areas. In dry years these frogs are difficult to find (Bartlett 1999).
","
Nocturnal and aboreal frog. Uses shallow temporary bodies of water as breeding sites (Savage 2002). 

During dry seasons S. baudinii seeks refuge in tree holes, outer sheaths of banana plants, or under bark. When attacked by a predator, both sexes emit high-pitched distress calls with their mouths wide open (Savage 2002). 
 
Usually breeds from June to October but in the more humid Caribbean lowlands, this frog appears to have a longer breeding season. (Duellman 1970). Males will usually call from the edge of water areas. Amplexus is axillary and takes place in the shallow waters. Females lay 2,500-3,500 eggs in a surface film. The eggs are black and cream in color and are 1.3 mm in diameter (1.5 mm including the vitelline membrane). Metamorphosis takes place 14-20 days after fertilization. Metamorphs are 12-15.5 mm in standard length (Savage 2002). 

Their mating call consists of a series of short, explosive ""wonk-wonk-wonk"" notes. Call groups are spaced 15 seconds to several minutes apart. On average notes last 0.11 seconds. The two frequencies emphasized are from 350Hz and 2500Hz. S.baudinii call in duets (Duellman 1970). 

One of a handful of frogs known to create cocoons of parchment like wrappings that cover themselves as a protective means to estivate during drought or dry seasons. (McDiarmid and Foster 1987). 
","

","
Although S. Baudinii seems to be able to adapt well to human impact, it is possible that development has reduced populations. Some historical peripheral populations have not been seen in a decade or more. This is a protected species by the state of Texas (Bartlett 1999).

","
Smilisca fodiens is a frog that can reach sizes of 54 - 63 mm. Females do not differ significantly from males in proportions. The relatively small head is slightly wider than long. The skin of the head is partly co-ossified with underlying cranial bones. The snout when dorsally viewed is acutely rounded and bluntly rounded from the lateral view. The canthal ridges are distinct, where they meet forms a bony internasal ridge. The ridge extends anteriorly to the tip of the snout. The pupil is horizontal and the iris is dull bronze. The hind limbs are short and robust. The fingers are long and have small discs. The fingers are slender and have no webbing. The toes have small amount of webbing. The terminal discs are smaller than the finger discs. The inner metatarsal tubercle is large, elliptical, and spade-like. The skin is granular on the belly, dorsum, and parts of the thighs but otherwise smooth. The vocal sac is subgular and bilobate, and the halves are narrowly separated. The tadpoles have short tails, are pelagic type, have a anteroventral mouth with a large beak, have large papillae both laterally and ventrally, and have two-thirds tooth rows (Trueb 1969).

Smilisca fodiens's closest relative is Smilisca dentata, from which it can be differentiated by S. fodiens having a bony ridge extending from a point between the nostrils to the tip of the acutely rounded snout, digits expanded into small discs, and vocal sacs connected medially in breeding males (Trueb 1969).

In life, the dorsum coloration ranges from tan, pale olive-brown, grey-brown, and pink-brown. There are longitudinal stripes and small spots with dark brown or red-brown coloration and dark brown or black outline. In preservative, the dorsal ground color varies from pale grey-tan to creamy/pink-tan (Trueb 1969).

There is variation in the pattern of stripe/spot arrangement, as well as slight coloration differences (Trueb 1969).
","
Smilisca fodiens occurs from south-central Arizona in the USA, southward along the Pacific coast through to western Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit and Colima in Mexico. Inland it is found from central Jalisco to northern Michoac√°n and adjacent Guanajuato, Mexico. It occurs from near sea level to about 1,490m (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).

In Arizona, S. fodiens lives in burrows in open mesquite grassland. In Mexico it is also found in tropical scrub forests (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).

Fieldwork in several localities along S. fodiens‚Äôs range has recorded well-preserved populations, especially those occurring in Biosphere Reserves. Based on the map in Trueb (1969), there appear to be many populations, particularly in the southern part of its range (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).

","
Smilisca fodiens is a terrestrial burrowing species, adapted to living in burrows where humidity is high (Ford and Finch 1994), and lives in xeric environments. It is common in temporary pools formed by rains where it also breeds (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010). The frogs time the onset of breeding with the summer rains from July through August (Ford and Finch 1994). These frogs aestivate by forming cocoons underground (Lannoo 2005).

The call of S. fodiens sounds like a duck quack, as it consists of a series of low-pitched notes (Trueb 1969).

","

","
While the population trend is stable, S. fodiens is threatened by agricultural development in some parts of its range, especially within its wide Mexican range. The species can, however, be found in several protected areas  (Santos-Barrera et al. 2010).
","

","
Modifications such as short, robust limbs, squat body, and heavily ossified head allow the frog to live a fossorial existence. The internasal and labial flanges of the frog are adaptations for phragmotic behavior (Trube 1969). Phragmosis involves the frogs using the bony skull to plug the burrow against predators, wind, and loss of moisture (Ford and Finch 1994).

Smilisca fodiens was previously within the genus Pternohyla, which was recently synonymized with Smilisca (Faivovich et al. 2005).

The species epithet, fodiens, comes from the Latin word fodio, meaning to dig; this refers to the digging adaptations of the spade-like inner metatarsal tubercles (Trueb 1969).

Trachycephalus coriaceus (previously Phrynohyas coriacea) is a relatively large tree frog. In the lowland rainforest of southeastern Peru, Duellman (2005) reported a snout-vent-length ranging from 52.0 - 59.5 mm for males (with an average of 55.73 +/- 2.33 mm) and 52.9 - 64.8 mm for females (with an average of 58.55 +/- 3.39 mm). The head is broad, roughly the same width as the body, and the snout is short and round on both dorsal view and profile. The tympanum is ¬æ the size of the eye and the thick supratympanic fold covers its upper edge. The dorsal skin is smooth, glandular, and thick. The ventral skin is areolate. Fingers and toes have round terminal discs and are relatively short. Fingers are ¬Ω webbed while toes are ¬æ webbed. Males have dark brown nuptial excrescences and paired lateral vocal sacks can be found posterior to the tympanum. Trachycephalus coriaceus tadpoles have an elongated, elliptical body that is widest just posterior to the eyes and throughout the midlength. The snout is round in dorsal view. When viewed in profile, the snout rounds off to a blunt tip anteroventrally. The eyes are positioned laterally. Infraorbital and supraorbital neuromast rows are conspicuous. The spiracle is on the left side of the body, and is completely attached to the body wall. The vent tube is dextral, just below the ventral fin. The caudal musculature is the same height throughout the anterior one-third of the tail length and tapers off into a thin tip towards the end. At the beginning of metamorphosis, the color of the limbs and the dorsum of the body are a pale green while the venter is a creamy white. The iris is a light orange. Metamorph individuals have brown dorsum with darker brown patterns (Duellman, 2005).

This species bears lateral vocal sacs and red webbing.  There are only two other treefrogs found in Madre de Dios that have red webbing: Hyla geographica (now Hypsiboas geographicus; Claudia Azevedo-Ramos et al. 2010) and Hyla triangulum.  Both of these species only overlap with a fraction of T. coriaecus' range. Hypsiboas geographicus has reticulated lower eyelids and calcars on the heels while H. triangulum is far smaller and has thin dorsal skin that differ the two species from T. coriaceus (Duellman 2005). 

In life, the dorsum and flanks of the female are mostly composed of shades of brown, including reddish brown and grayish tan. In some individuals, the dorsum can have distinct, peculiar patterning: a large, brown rectangular shaped blotch that extends from the upper eyelids to the lower sacral region. and another smaller, horizontal, rectangular blotch below the sacrum. These dorsal markings are enclosed by narrow black and pale cream outlines. A black spot can be found posterior to the tympanum and below the supratympanic fold. The ventral surfaces of the shanks, the webbing of hands and feet, the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thighs, and inner surfaces of the feet are all red. The throat, belly, and sides are creamy yellow. The eyes are pale-orange with a metallic luster. When preserved, the dorsal markings may or may not be present. The species appears washed away, with the dorsal side being a homogenous brown and the ventral a dull tan or cream (Duellman 2005).

Tadpole body coloration changes from black to a dull brown during tadpole development. Specifically, both the dorsal and the sides of the body are colored dark brown to black while the ventral side is a contrasting silvery white. The caudal musculature is the same color as the dorsal side with two pale, broad lines running down the side, narrowing and converging distally. The fins are light grey. After preservation, the body becomes tan. There is an area above the snout that is a diffused brown. Posterior to the orbit is a brown blotch while below the orbit is a brown crescent-shape spot. The fins are translucent. The dorsal and ventral sides of the caudal musculature are dark brown while the rest of the caudal musculature is a creamy tan (Duellman 2005).
  
","
Trachycephalus coriaceus is found in the Madre de Dios region in Peru, bordering Brazil and Bolivia.  It is also found in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, and Suriname. Individuals are mainly found inhabiting inundated (flooded) forests, but may also be found in camp clearings and terra firma (‚Äúsolid earth‚Äù or un-flooded) forest (Angulo et al. 2010). 
","
This species is arboreal and nocturnal, and has a sit-and-wait foraging strategy (Duellman 2005). This species has been known to exhibit a defensive behavior that involves inflating itself to appear larger than it really is. This larger size may also make the individual more difficult to consume. In addition, this inflation emphasizes the two black spots on the flanks, posterior to the tympanum by making them visible from the front.  However, these two defensive mechanisms, the puffing up of the body and the flash coloration, have not been observed as a response to a predator confrontation, but only seen when the individual is handled by a human (De la Riva 1994).

Most individuals congregate at permanent and temporary pools for breeding. During the breeding season, males exhibit a loud growl as an advertisement call while floating on the water and fully inflated. When inflated the paired lateral vocal sacs of the male inflate upward and over the head, nearly touching. Females oviposit eggs in a surface film on the water (Duellman 2005).
","

","
The species as a whole is probably not threatened. However, it is likely that local populations are threatened by deforestation (Angulo et al. 2010).
","
Cashinahua Indians (Balta, Departamento Ucayali) and the Achuar Indians in Ecuador are known to consume this species. Additional research is required in order to determine if this species is exploited as a source of protein in other locations (Angulo et al. 2010).
","
There has been a recent taxonomic change for this species: it was previously known as Phrynohyas coriacea (Angulo et al. 2010).

Trachycephalus venulosus is a large frog, with adult males 70 to 101 mm and adult females 93 to 114 mm in snout-vent length. The head is wider than long, with a round and blunt snout and medium-sized eyes. The tympanum is distinct and rather large, having a diameter 50 to 80% of the diameter of the eyes, and is larger in females than males. The body is robust. The dorsal skin is thick and glandular, with the highest concentration of glands near the back and sides of the head.  Dorsal skin texture is strongly tuberculate in juveniles and may be tuberculate or smooth in adults.  Ventrally, the skin is quite areolate on the throat, venter, and posteroventral area of the thighs. Fingers are short and robust and have large expanded finger discs, with the third finger disc being larger than the tympanum. Fingers are moderately webbed, while the toes have a large amount of webbing. The hand has an enlarged thenar tubercle pad and a bifid distal subarticular tubercle underneath the fourth finger; the palmar tubercle is lacking.  The foot has an ovoid, average-sized inner metatarsal tubercle, a small, conical outer metatarsal tubercle and a very clear tarsal fold.  Males have paired, lateral, expandable vocal sacs (unique among Costa Rican hylids), located behind the angles of the jaw when not inflated. Males also have a tan nuptial pad, lacking spines, on the base of the thumb. Bones are green, as in other frogs of the genus Trachycephalus, distinguishing this genus from other hylids (Savage 2002; this genus was formerly named Phrynohyas). Green bones are also present in centrolenid frogs. 

This species can be distinguished from other treefrogs by its uniformly colored flanks and green bones, and the lack of dark vertical barring on the lip; additionally, males can be distinguished by the paired lateral vocal sacs, one on either side of the head behind the angle of the jaw (Savage 2002).

Dorsally, the frog is yellowish tan, tan, reddish brown, or pale gray in color. The ventral surface may be dirty light brown to cream. Adults typically have a large, dark olive tan to brown mark on the back that takes up almost the whole dorsal surface. Occasionally light spots are present on the dorsum, broken by transverse bands of the body color. Limbs tend to have transverse dark bars on the upper surfaces, though some individuals lack barring. Vocal sacs are pale or olive brown when inflated, but look dark brown or black when deflated. Irises are golden bronze with tiny splotches of black (Savage 2002).

Tadpoles of Trachycephalus venulosus are large, with a robust body measuring 41 mm in total length (Savage 2002). The tadpoles have a pond type body form with a forward facing mouth (anteroventral), eyes that are facing laterally and deep, high fins tapering to the end of the pointed tail (Zweifel 1964). Nostrils are anterolateral. The spiracle is lateral and on the left (sinistral) and the vent tube is medial (located in the middle of the body;  Savage 2002). The younger tadpoles have complete beaks that gradually become poorly developed as the tadpole grows larger (Zweifel 1964). Oral discs are very small compared to the body, with the diameter being only about 44% of the body, and the edges are able to fold up make a shape like a triangle which closes the mouth (Zweifel 1964). Papillae are present, but not above the mouth, being located laterally and ventrally with the lowest row or two fragmented (Savage 2002). Beaks are finely serrated (Savage 2002). Tooth rows in the tadpoles may be 3-4 rows on the top and 4-6 rows on the bottom (Zweifel 1964; Savage 2002). Zweifel (1964) described a large space in the first row of upper denticles, and many spaces in the lower denticle rows (Zweifel 1964). Savage's (2002) description mentions A1 and A2 being present only laterally, and usually fragmented, with a slight median gap in the row just above the mouth (A2 or A3), and sometimes the row just below (P1) also with a narrow median gap. This tooth formula varies greatly from the typical Hyla larvae that have a 2/3 tooth row, and those species with more tooth rows do not have the gaps that T. venulosus has (Zweifel 1964).

Tadpoles have a brown dorsum and a creamy tan ventral surface with small brown splotches. The body has a brown stripe down the body lengthwise. Fins have small dark flecks of coloration and developed legs have a lengthwise dark stripe. The iris is a pale brown (Savage 2002). 

","
This species has a wide range in Central and northern South America. It lives in lowland forests which may be dry, moist, or wet, at an elevation of 2-285 m (Savage 2002).

","
This is a nocturnal frog typically found perching on tree branches and vegetation while foraging at night. It shelters in bromeliads, tree holes, under tree bark of both living and dead trees, or in banana or heliconia sheaths during the dry season. During the rainy season, which is also the breeding season, these frogs are found near temporary ponds (Savage 2002).

Males call from the breeding site, while floating in the shallow water, their inflated lateral vocal sacs noticeable on either side of the head (Savage 2002). The advertisement call is described as a loud growl, repeated at regular, short intervals. Notes are repeated 42 to 69 times per minute with each note lasting between 230 and 400 ms (Savage 2002). The dominant frequency is from 1.39 to 2.5 kHz, and the call has 12 to 14 harmonics (Duellman 1970; Lee 1996). Males can be heard calling in groups of 5-10, or rarely in larger groups of 20-40 (Gottsberger and Gruber 2004). Most calls occur during the first night of explosive breeding (Gottsberger and Gruber 2004).

Trachycephalus venulosus also has a distinct distress call. The call starts with a 'squeaklike' sound that probably comes from constricted airways, followed by three bursts of sound lasting between .29 and .38 seconds (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998). Analysis of a recorded call shows that the sound bursts were separated by intervals of 1.405 and 3.014 seconds (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998). The first two sound bursts had a fundamental frequency of 260 Hz with a dominant frequency of 3.27 to 5.67 kHz while the third had a higher dominant frequency of 4.75 and 7.08 kHz (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998). After the distress call, many frogs were observed coming out of hiding in trees and going towards the calling frog; shortly after the frog escaped, the responding frogs returned to their hiding places (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998).

Breeding is explosive after heavy rains (Savage 2002). After amplexus occurs in the water, females lay eggs as a film on the water surface, with the film covering a total of 1.5 square meters (Zweifel 1964). Eggs were recorded to be developing at temperatures ranging from 27 to 33 degrees Celsius (Zweifel 1964). The eggs, which have a diameter of 3.5 mm, hatch after one day into free-living tadpoles at stage 18, with a length of 3.8 to 4.4 mm (Savage 2002). Metamorphosis into an adult takes between 37 to 47 days (Zweifel 1964; Pyburn 1967). Some aspects of larval coloration are retained initially, such as a dark leg stripe and green bones, but are quickly lost within a few days and replaced by the full adult coloration (Savage 2002).

The tadpoles have very large gills, most likely as an adaptation to living in warm water with a low oxygen level (Zweifel 1964). Tadpoles have been observed to spread out the gills at the surface of the water (Zweifel 1964). Combined with the large lungs, these tadpoles are well suited for life in small ponds (Zweifel 1964). The larvae feed by scraping surfaces underneath the water (Savage 2002). In the wild, tadpoles consume planktonic algae (Rossa-Feres et al. 2004). In the laboratory, tadpoles were fed successfully with canned spinach and sometimes boiled lettuce (Zweifel 1964). 

Adults of this species have granular glands in the skin, concentrated in the dorsal pustules and in the interorbital, occipital, supratympanic, and anterior dorsal areas (McDiarmid 1968). These glands can secrete a large amount of sticky white, volatile, poisonous, alkaline, water-insoluble mucus, when the frog is handled (Savage 2002). The glands along the side of the neck look normal during the wet season (from late June onwards), but in the dry season (February and March) they become greatly enlarged and can cover most of the tympanum (McDiarmid 1968). The mucus deters predators; in one documented case, a frog released a large amount of milky white mucus on an attacking snake's head, causing the snake to release the frog because it was so covered in the thick mucus it could not close its mouth or see (Leary and Razafindratsita 1998).  The mucus is also sticky and water-insoluble, so frogs may make use of it to combat desiccation during the dry season by reducing water loss through the skin (Savage 2002). Some may even line tree holes with the secretion to help keep moist, as is the case for South American members of this genus (Savage 2002; Veillardi 1948).

These frogs also have a highly developed ability to parachute from trees (Cott 1926). One was observed gliding for 27 m, after being dropped from a height of 43 m (Cott 1926). The frog was not simply falling, because it consistently descended with the back facing upwards and the legs spread out laterally (Oliver 1951).
","

","
Currently, this species is listed as Least Concern (IUCN 2006). In one study, no individuals of Trachycephalus venulosus were found over a 3 year period, but since the previous study had only found 3, it is not necessarily declining (Eterovick et al. 2005).  More likely it has always been present in very low numbers in that area of Brazil (Eterovick et al. 2005). Furthermore, this species is very widespread in Central and South America, so the populations there are most likely not in any danger of declines (IUCN 2006).
","
This frog produces sticky, insoluble, noxious secretions that cause severe reactions, ranging from irritation, swelling, and pain to temporary blindness if the secretions end up in the eyes or on any mucous membrane (Savage 2002). It is called the 'pepper treefrog' in Belize because it is thought to cause sneezing (Meyer and Foster 1996).

","
This species was treated as Phrynohyas venulosa in Savage (2002).  

The karyotype is 2N = 24; all chromosomes are metacentric or subtelocentric (Bogart 1973).
